       "['The treatment of chronic diseases consumes 86% of U.S. healthcare costs. While healthcare organizations have traditionally focused on treating the complications of chronic diseases, advances in information technology (IT) and analytics can help clinicians and patients manage and slow the progression of chronic diseases to result in higher quality of life for patients and lower healthcare costs. We build on prior research to introduce the notion of temporal displacement of care (TDC), in which IT and analytics create healthcare value by displacing the time at which providers and patients make interventions to improve healthcare outcomes and reduce costs. We propose that healthcare value is created by strategic actions taken at specific points-in-time during the treatment process. Our theoretical development identifies TDC mechanisms through which IT and analytics displace later high cost interventions in favor of earlier preventative procedures. We test our hypotheses using four years of data on 45,000 cardio-metabolic patients from the U.S. state of Vermont, which implemented a Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) program. Our study includes four cohorts with increasing levels of IT and analytics use: (1) non-PCMH practices, (2) PCMH practices with basic IT systems installed, (3) practices that completed data quality sprints (DQS) to increase use of IT systems, and (4) practices that use analytics through the Vermont Healthcare Information Exchange (VHIE). Our results provide insights into how TDC effects develop over time. In Year 1 after implementation, the DQS cohort demonstrates a marked increase in the use of preventative procedures such as eye exams and neuropathy screenings, the increase becomes more pronounced in Years 2 and 3, and the increase is even greater for the VHIE cohort. As the use of preventative procedures increases, emergency department utilization decreases, with a more pronounced decrease for the VHIE cohort than the DQS cohort. By Year 2, the DQS and VHIE cohorts experience a decrease in total healthcare costs, with a greater decrease for the VHIE cohort than the DQS cohort. By Year 3, the healthcare outcomes indicator of Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level is statistically significantly lower, with a greater decrease for the VHIE cohort than the DQS cohort. The increased use of low-intervention healthcare treatments earlier in the process leads to a decrease in overall healthcare costs, which then leads to an improvement in healthcare indicators. ',\n",
       " 'Scalability and privacy form two critical dimensions that will eventually determine the extent of the success of big data analytics. We present scalable approaches to address privacy concerns when sharing transactional databases. Although the benefits of sharing are well documented and the number of firms sharing transactional data has increased over the years, the rate at which this number has grown is not quite what it could have been. Concerns about revealing proprietary information have prevented some retailers from sharing, despite the obvious advantages in an increasingly networked economy. In the context of sharing transactional data, sensitive information is typically based on relationships derived from frequently occurring itemsets, result of surprisingly successful promotions by the retailer, or unexpected relationships identified by the retailer while mining the data. Prior work in this area includes optimal approaches based on integer programming to maximize the accuracy of shared databases, while hiding all sensitive itemsets. While these approaches were shown to solve problems involving up to 10 million transactions, many transactional databases in the big data context are considerably larger and the existing integer programming-based procedures do not scale well enough to solve these larger problems. Consequently, there is no effective solution procedure for such databases in extant literature. In this paper, we first present an optimal procedure leveraging intuition from linear programming based column generation. Next, we identify a common structure that exists in these problems, and show how it can be taken advantage of through an approach based on sorting and column generation to make the process more efficient. We then illustrate how this structure can be incorporated into the column generation based procedure to develop an effective, scalable heuristic. Computational experiments are conducted on databases with 50 million and 100 million transactions, involving problems that could not be solved using existing optimal procedures. These experiments show that the optimal column generation based procedure can solve problem instances significantly larger than those tackled previously, and that the scalable heuristic identifies near-optimal solutions quickly in all instances where the optimal solution is known. We investigate the impact of hiding sensitive itemsets on the quality of a rule-based recommender system derived from the shared data. As expected, recommendation quality decreases as the number of sensitive itemsets increases; however, recommendation accuracy stays above 80% of the original rate when using the unmodified data even when there are 1,000 sensitive itemsets to hide. The effect on recommendation accuracy from using the heuristic relative to the optimal approach was very small: the accuracies with the heuristic were over 97% of the corresponding accuracies with the optimal approach in every experiment, and over 99% in the vast majority.

       " \"Recent work has shown that a firm's plural sourcing strategy, which determines how much it chooses to make versus how much it chooses to buy, requires consideration of the complementarities and constraints that affect the differential advantages of making and buying. Elaborating on this perspective, we theorize how (mis)fit between a firm's plural sourcing strategy of simultaneously making and buying and its development of information technology (IT) enabled interfirm and intrafirm process integration capabilities influences firm performance in deregulated markets. We position our theory development and empirical tests in the context of the power-generation segment of the U.S. electric utility industry (EUI), an asset-intensive industry that has been deregulated to promote the separation of key value chain activities (i.e., generation, transmission, and distribution) and the development of wholesale energy markets. We draw on the transaction cost economics, coordination costs, and IT capabilities perspectives to theorize that a firm achieves fit (realizing performance benefits) by increasing market sourcing intensity (MSI)—or, how much it buys relative to how much it makes— and developing IT-enabled interfirm process integration capability for external coordination with the market, or misfit (realizing performance penalties) by increasing MSI and developing IT-enabled intrafirm process integration capability for coordinating internal production. We collated data from archival sources for 342 utility firms in the power-generation segment to construct a panel dataset for the period 1994-2004 on (1) firms' MSI from wholesale electricity markets, (2) firms' IT investment decisions to develop interfirm and intrafirm process integration capabilities, (3) measures of firm performance, and (4) several control variables related to exogenous shocks (i.e., regulatory change, oil crisis), region of operation, and firm-level factors. Our results suggest that fit between MSI and the development of IT-enabled interfirm process integration capability improves firm profitability, assessed by return on assets, and misfit between MSI and the development of IT-enabled intrafirm process integration capability extracts penalties in firm profitability. We also find evidence that fit between MSI and the development of IT-enabled interfirm process integration capability improves market valuation, assessed by Tobin's Q, and asset turnover, assessed by operating revenue/total assets. We discuss the implications of our findings for the development of IT capabilities to accompany a firm's plural sourcing strategy and the literature on IT business value. \",\n",
       " 'The digital divide is usually conceptualized through goods-dominant logic, where bridging the divide entails providing digital goods to disadvantaged segments of the population.

In contrast, this study is anchored in an alternative service-dominant logic and posits that viewing the divide from a service perspective might be better suited to the context of developing countries, where there is a huge divide across societal segments in accessing basic services such as healthcare and education. This research views the prevailing differences in the level of services consumed by different population segments (service divide) as the key issue to be addressed by innovative digital tools in developing countries. The study posits that information and communication technologies (ICTs) can be leveraged to bridge the service divide to enhance the capabilities of service-disadvantaged segments of society. But such service delivery requires an innovative assembly of ICT as well as non-ICT resources. Building on concepts from service-dominant logic and service science, this paper aims to understand how such service innovation efforts can be orchestrated. Specifically, adopting a process view, two Indian enterprises that have developed sustainable telemedicine healthcare service delivery models for the rural population in India are examined. The study traces the configurations of three interactional resources—knowledge, technology, and institutions—through which value-creating usercentric objectives of increasing geographical access and reducing cost are achieved. The theoretical contributions are largely associated with unearthing and understanding how the three interactional resources were orchestrated for service-centric value creation in different combinative patterns as resource exploitation, resource combination, and value reinforcement. The analysis also reveals the three distinct stages of service innovation evolution (idea and launch, infancy and early growth, and late growth and expansion), with a distinct shift in the dominant resource for each stage. Through an inductive process, the study also identifies four key enablers for successfully implementing these ICT-enabled service innovations: obsessive customer empathy, belief in the transformational power of ICT, continuous recursive learning, and efficient network orchestration.

       " \"Online crowdsourcing markets (OCM) are becoming more popular as a source for data collection. In this paper, we examine the consistency of survey results across student samples, consumer panels, and online crowdsourcing markets (specifically Amazon's Mechanical Turk) both within the United States and outside. We conduct two studies examining the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the expectation- disconfirmation theory (EDT) to explore potential differences in demographics, psychometrics, structural model estimates, and measurement invariances. Our findings indicate that (1) U.S.-based OCM samples provide demographics much more similar to our student and consumer panel samples than the non-U.S.-based OCM samples; (2) both U.S. and non-U.S. OCM samples provide initial psychometric properties (reliability, convergent, and divergent validity) that are similar to those of both student and consumer panels; (3) non-U.S. OCM samples generally provide differences in scale means compared to those of our students, consumer panels, and U.S. OCM samples; and (4) one of the non-U.S. OCM samples refuted the highly replicated and validated TAM model in the relationship of perceived usefulness to behavioral intentions. Although our post hoc analyses isolated some cultural and demographic effects with regard to the non-U.S. samples in Study 1, they did not address the model differences found in Study 2. Specifically, the inclusion of non-U.S. OCM respondents led to statistically significant differences in parameter estimates, and hence to different statistical conclusions. Due to these unexplained differences that exist within the non-U.S. OCM samples, we caution that the inclusion of non-U.S. OCM participants may lead to different conclusions than studies with only U.S. OCM participants. We are unable to conclude whether this is due to of cultural differences, differences in the demographic profiles of non-U.S. OCM participants, or some unexplored factors within the models. Therefore, until further research is conducted to explore these differences in detail, we urge researchers utilizing OCMs with the intention to generalize to U.S. populations focus on U.S.-based participants and exercise caution in using non-U.S. participants. We further recommend that researchers should clearly describe their OCM usage and design (e.g., demographics, participant filters, etc.) procedures. Overall, we find that U.S. OCM samples produced models that lead to similar statistical conclusions as both U.S. students and U.S. consumer panels at a considerably reduced cost. \",\n",
       " 'As business and technology environments change at an unprecedented rate, software development agility to respond to changing user requirements has become increasingly critical for software development performance. Agile software development approaches, which emphasize sense-and-respond, self-organization, cross-functional teams, and continuous adaptation, have been adopted by an increasing number of organizations to improve their software development agility. However, the agile development literature is largely anecdotal and prescriptive, lacking empirical evidence and theoretical foundation to support the principles and practices of agile development. Little research has empirically examined the software development agility construct in terms of its dimensions, determinants, and effects on software development performance. As a result, there is a lack of understanding about how organizations can effectively implement an agile development approach. Using an integrated research approach that combines quantitative and qualitative data analyses, this research opens the black box of agile development by empirically examining the relationships among two dimensions of software development agility (software team response extensiveness and software team response efficiency), two antecedents that can be controlled (team autonomy and team diversity), and three aspects of software development performance (on-time completion, on-budget completion, and software functionality). Our PLS results of survey responses of 399 software project managers suggest that the relationships among these variables are more complex than what has been perceived by the literature. The results suggest a tradeoff relationship between response extensiveness and response efficiency. These two agility dimensions impact software development performance differently: response efficiency positively affects all of on-time completion, on-budget completion, and software functionality, whereas response extensiveness positively affects only software functionality. The results also suggest that team autonomy has a positive effect on response efficiency and a negative effect on response extensiveness, and that team diversity has a positive effect on response extensiveness. We conducted 10 post hoc case studies to qualitatively cross-validate our PLS results and provide rich, additional insights regarding the complex, dynamic interplays between autonomy, diversity, agility, and performance. The qualitative analysis also provides explanations for both supported and unsupported hypotheses. We discuss these qualitative analysis results and conclude with the theoretical and practical implications of our research findings for agile development approaches. ',\n",
       " \"This study was initiated in response to concerns expressed by the membership of the Boston Chapter of the Society for Information Management (Boston SIM) to investigate anticipated changes in the information systems (IS) profession, to study the impact of these changes on the skills and knowledge requirements, and to relate these requirements to the academic preparation of future IS professionals. To provide as broad a perspective as possible, the study was conducted by a joint industry/academic group of investigators. A series of focus group meetings was conducted first with representatives of the profession's different stake- holder groups (i.e., IS managers, user managers, and IS consultants) for issue generation. A survey instrument was then designed for data collection on computing trends and changing knowledge and skiffs requirements. Overall, our study suggests that industry' will demand a cadre Otis professionals with knowledge and skills in technology, business operations, management, and interpersonal skills to effectively lead organizational integration and process reengineering activities. The lower-level IS jobs are rapidly disappearing, and the requirements for IS professionals ate becoming morn demanding in multiple dimensions, particularly in the areas of business functional knowledge and interpersonal/management skills. Our results also found some clear patterns in IS staffing and activity trends that point to the shift in emphasis from a traditional, central IS organization toward a more decentralized, end-user-focused business orientation. Aligning IS solutions with business goals and needs as well as building the infrastructure for technological integration are becoming the top priorities for IS activities. Our results indicate these changes will likely lead to different camel tracks with differing emphasis on the multi-dimensional knowledge/skills for IS professionals. The realignment of IS activities in organizations will require corresponding re-structuring of IS curricula at universities. Our findings suggest that current IS curricula am often ill-matched with business needs. Many subjects emphasized in the typical IS curricula am assigned low priorities by practitioners, while them is pressing need to add both breadth and depth Iv the education of IS professionals. We argue further That the concept of a generic curriculum to meet The educational needs of all future IS professionals is obsolete, and different IS curricula must be tailored to meet the needs of different IS careers. These career driven IS pro grams will require the adoption of multi-disciplinary approaches and educational innovations for adding breadth, depth. and relevance to the curriculum in accordance with the focused mission of each specific program. \",\n",
       " 'Many organizations and software firms these days use pair programming to meet the challenges posed by digital transformations and to meet customer needs. They use pair programming to become more agile and responsive to their competitive environment. Although some studies suggest that pair programming can potentially increase the quality of developed software code and the satisfaction and confidence of developers, very little is known as to how pair programming affects team performance. Therefore, we conducted an empirical study at one of the largest enterprise software firms that serves a large number of Fortune 500 companies, and we collected data from the software developers, Scrum masters, and product owners of 62 software development teams. Our findings show that pair programming affects team performance positively by changing cognitive structures and behavioral patterns in software teams. Pair programming helps team members develop shared mental models and, as a consequence, increases backup behavior among team members. Backup behavior is particularly valuable for teams facing high task novelty. Our findings have critical implications for organizations and senior managers as they lead their digital transformation efforts where they often rely on autonomous teams for providing digital innovation. We show that pair programming can be a key ingredient for high-performance teams. Establishing the practice of pair programming promises to be particularly valuable for those teams that lack shared mental models and teams whose members fail to provide each other backup. This study examines the team-level effects of pair programming by developing a research model that accounts for mediators and moderators of the relationship between pair programming and team performance. We hypothesize that pair programming helps software development teams establish backup behavior by strengthening the shared mental models among developers. In turn, backup behavior attenuates the negative effect of task novelty on team performance. We collect data from the software developers, Scrum masters, and product owners of 62 software development teams in a global enterprise software firm and find broad support for our research model. The study makes important contributions by shifting attention to the team-level effects of pair programming and by explicating mediating and moderating mechanisms related to the roles of shared mental models, backup behavior, and task novelty. The results underline the importance of viewing pair programming as a context-specific practice that helps establish backup behavior in teams. In terms of implications for practitioners, our results show that pair programming can be a valuable element of team governance to create shared mental models and backup behavior and to achieve high team performance when teams face high levels of task novelty.

       " 'For many products, particularly digital content, consumers base purchase-related decisions on not only others\\' evaluations (e.g., online reviews) but also their own direct experiences (e.g., previews). Many of them therefore combine \"seeing\" through their own encounters with \"believing\" the assessments of others, often being confronted with a situation wherein the former contradicts the latter. This study investigates the dynamics underlying the interactive relationships between online reviews and previews to shed light on how consumers collectively use these pre-buying resources as guidance in purchasing e-books. Our research reveals that consumers wisely leverage previews in accordance with the characteristics of reviews (e.g., volume, valence, and variance). The positive effects of previews increase with decreasing review volume and average valence. Consumers also rely heavily on previews in situations wherein a high variance exists among the indirect evaluations of reviewers. We detect the presence of order effects with respect to exposure to previews and reviews; exposure to previews after accessing reviews more effectively drives sales than when exposure to reviews precedes the encounters. These results provide content providers with useful managerial insights into how they can maximize consumers\\' overall prepurchase experiences and enhance content sales through the excellent leveraging of previews and reviews. Online reviews offer consumers the indirect experience of products through others\\' consumption evaluations, whereas previews afford them direct experience through product trials. Although conceptual and empirical studies on the business ramifications of online reviews abound, little is known about how online previews moderate the effects of online reviews on sales. To cast light on this issue, the current research investigated the interactive effects of exposure to online previews and reviews on individual purchase decisions. We analyzed a unique two-month panel data set on 270,260 sessions that comprise clickstream data on consumers\\' exposure to previews and reviews and data on their subsequent purchase behaviors. On the basis of analyses underlain by a two-stage hierarchical Bayesian framework, we found that online previews positively influence individual purchase decisions. More importantly, significant interactions exist between previews and reviews, as evidenced by the decreasing positive effect of previews with increasing review volume and average review rating. In addition, previews can complement reviews when a high variance in the latter renders purchase decisions difficult. We further examined the sequence effect of exposure to previews and reviews and discovered that exposure to previews following the experience of reviews may exert a considerable positive influence on individual purchase decisions. The results from an additional field experiment and a text-based sentiment analysis reinforced the validity of our main findings by mitigating concerns regarding the endogeneity and the accuracy of the review quality, respectively. The findings provide practical implications with regard to the design of optimal strategies for releasing preview information to digital platforms. ',\n",
       " \"Effective use of electronic health records (EHRs) is considered an important step toward the goal of improving the quality of U.S. healthcare, while reducing its costs. However, did EHRs and a meaningful use (MU) initiative increase the risk of a breach of patient information as many people were worried about? This study shows that implementing EHRs led to a 3.081 times higher risk of a breach of patient information. This heightened risk was mostly driven by the occurrence of more accidental breaches. Undertaking MU initiatives increased the risk of accidental breaches by 1.771 times, but not the risk of malicious breaches. We also found that these risks increased more among relatively larger hospitals. We conclude that despite recent evidence that the usage of EHRS has improved the quality of healthcare, quality must go hand in hand with the protection of patient information. Thus, we argue that the government's future revision of the criteria for MU should better reflect the risk of accidental breaches. Our study also suggests that policy makers should carefully address the possible increase in the risk of privacy breaches when considering whether to promote industry-wide adoption of digitized data and processes. Given the cost of electronic health records (EHRs) to society and hospitals and the heightened concern about breaches of patient information, it is imperative to understand the risks that EHRs and the pursuit of a meaningful use (MU) initiative, apart from actual attestation of MU, may pose to the privacy of patient information. In this study, we examine how the adoption of EHRs and an MU initiative affect the occurrence of breaches of patient information. We also study whether and how EHRs and MU initiatives may increase the risk of accidental and malicious breaches of patient information. Using data from multiple sources, such as the American Hospital Association (AHA), the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) Analytics™ Database, and the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse (PRC), our study shows that implementing EHRs leads to a 3.081 times higher risk of a breach of patient information. This heightened risk is mostly driven by the occurrence of more accidental breaches. Although the effect of an MU initiative on the overall number of breaches is not significant, undertaking MU increases the risk of accidental breaches 1.771 times. We also found that these risks increased more among relatively larger hospitals. However, simply having more components of EHRs does not necessarily increase the risk of breaches. Overall, our findings show that breaches of patient information may be rooted in the digitized data and processes enabled by technologies such as EHRs and their usage rather than resident in the technological components themselves. We conclude that, despite recent evidence that usage of EHRS has improved the quality of healthcare, quality must go hand in hand with the protection of patient information. \",\n",
       " 'The rise of online shopping cart–tracking technologies enables new opportunities for e-commerce cart targeting (ECT). However, practitioners might target shoppers who have short-listed products in their digital carts without fully considering how ECT designs interact with consumer mindsets in online shopping stages. The authors find that ECT has a substantial impact on consumer purchases, inducing a 29.9% higher purchase rate than e-commerce targeting without carts. Moreover, this incremental impact is moderated: the ECT design with a price incentive amplifies the impact, but the same price incentive leads to ineffective e-commerce targeting without carts. By contrast, a scarcity message attenuates the impact but significantly boosts purchase responses to targeting without carts. Interestingly, the costless scarcity nudge is approximately 2.3 times more effective than the costly price incentive in the early shopping stage without carts, whereas a price incentive is 11.4 times more effective than the scarcity message in the late stage with carts. The authors also leverage a causal forest algorithm that can learn purchase response heterogeneity to develop a practical scheme of optimizing ECT. These findings empower managers to prudently target consumer shopping interests embedded in digital carts in order to capitalize new opportunities in e-commerce. The rise of online shopping cart–tracking technologies enables new opportunities for e-commerce cart targeting (ECT). However, practitioners might target shoppers who have short-listed products in their digital carts without fully considering how ECT designs interact with consumer mindsets in online shopping stages. This paper develops a conceptual model of ECT that addresses the question of when (with versus without carts) and how to target (scarcity versus price promotion). Our ECT model is grounded in the consumer goal stage theory of deliberative or implemental mindsets and supported by a two-stage field experiment involving more than 22,000 mobile users. The results indicate that ECT has a substantial impact on consumer purchases, inducing a 29.9% higher purchase rate than e-commerce targeting without carts. Moreover, this incremental impact is moderated: the ECT design with a price incentive amplifies the impact, but the same price incentive leads to ineffective e-commerce targeting without carts.

       " \"Live chat tools have emerged as a channel for fostering synchronous communication between sellers and buyers. However, a positive link between live chat and conversion does not suggest causation because customers with high purchase intention are more likely to initiate live chat in the first place. Our research accounts for such selection and studies the impact of live chat with the presence of information cues: product sales volumes and seller feedback scores. Using granular data from Alibaba, we find that live chat can increase purchase probability of tablets by 15.99%. Further, the substitutional or complementary patterns between live chat and the information cues allow us to understand how live chat tools change the ways consumers evaluate product quality and seller credibility. We observe a substitutional effect of live chat on seller feedback score such that sellers with low feedback scores benefit more from live chat conversations than sellers with high scores. On the contrary, products with a high past sales volume sell better after live chat, indicating a reinforcement effect. Such findings deepen our understanding of the difference between various information cues in electronic markets and delineate the specific type of benefit live chat brings if put into best use by sellers and online marketplace designers. Live chat tools have emerged as a channel for fostering synchronous communication between sellers and buyers. The role of live chat in the e-commerce environment, however, is largely underexplored. Using granular data from Alibaba, we examine the effect of live chat on consumers' purchase decisions. After controlling for the selection process that customers with high purchase intention are more likely to initiate live chat in the first place, we find that live chat can increase purchase probability of tablets by 15.99%. We also investigate how the effect of live chat is moderated by existing information cues: product sales volume and seller feedback score.

As one of the first systematic studies to investigate live chat, our paper contributes to web trust conceptual frameworks with empirical analyses and sheds light on practical decisions faced by e-vendors and platform designers. \",\n",
       " 'Operating on the basic principle of \"telling people about what lots of other people do,\" social norms interventions have demonstrated efficacy in inducing behavior change in diverse settings. However, very few studies examine how the effect of social norms is differentially manifest across individuals, especially in the contemporary socially connected digital world. We provide new empirical evidence from a randomized field experiment that included more than 7,000 individuals on an online physical activity community observed for a two-month period. We find that connectivity plays an important role in moderating the effectiveness of social norms: individuals with higher levels of social connectivity are more susceptible to a social norms message. Additional analysis reveals that individuals who engage in information sharing (high followers and low followees) are the most susceptible to the social norms message. This study has important implications for the effective and safe use of social norms in nudging people\\'s behavior. Our finding that social norms do not affect all users equally should help optimize interventions by focusing on users with high susceptibility based on easily observable measures. Abundant empirical evidence supports the overall efficacy of social norms as a strategy to induce behavior change. However, very few studies examine how the effect of social norms is differentially manifest across individuals, especially in the contemporary socially connected digital world. We conjecture that the effects of social norms are conditional on an individual\\'s digital social ties and provide new empirical evidence from a randomized field experiment that included more than 7,000 individuals on an online physical activity community observed for a two-month period. In our investigation of the effect of social norms on users\\' goal-setting and goal attainment behaviors, we find a significant moderating role for social connectivity: individuals with higher levels of social connectivity are more susceptible to a social norms message containing information indicating the number of users in this community who set a goal in the pretreatment month. Additional analysis reveals that individuals who have many followers (i.e., high in-degree) but do not follow many others (low out-degree) are the most susceptible to the social norms treatment. Strikingly, we find that social norms also lead to a substantially lower rate of goal attainment compared with the control message that simply highlights the benefits of setting a goal. This adverse effect is also heterogeneously experienced, conditional on the number of social ties. Our findings have important implications for the design of interventions based on social norms.

       " 'Product recommendations are ubiquitous in platform-based markets. This paper investigates the externality of platform-provided recommendations by focusing on the demand spillover to related products. In the context of the fast-growing mobile app market, we systematically examine the spillover effect on three groups of related apps: apps by the same developer, apps with similar functionality, and the same apps marketed on a different platform. We distinguish two mechanisms that potentially drive the externality: exposure spillover and quality endorsement spillover. We find that both spillover mechanisms can drive the externality, but their strength and relative importance vary depending on the specific relationship between the featured and nonfeatured products. Furthermore, our heterogeneity analysis suggests that the strength of the spillover effect also depends on the salient characteristics of the featured products including price and user rating. Many e-commerce platforms offer editor-curated recommendations to help consumers overcome the difficulty of discovering and evaluating new products. Whereas it is well recognized that the spotlight generated by editor recommendations has a positive effect on the sales of featured products, there is much less understanding in the literature on whether the spotlight influences the sales of other products that are not featured but are related to the featured products and how this externality varies depending on the specific relationship between the featured and nonfeatured products. By leveraging a novel data set collected from the mobile app market, this paper systematically investigates the spillover effect of platform-provided editor recommendations on three groups of related apps: apps by the same developer, apps with similar functionality, and the same apps marketed on a different platform. We distinguish the two mechanisms that potentially drive the externality: exposure spillover and quality endorsement spillover. We find that the overall spillover effect is positive for all three groups, but the underlying mechanisms are different. For the apps by the same developer and the same apps on a different platform, we find a significantly positive spillover of exposure, but the spillover of quality endorsement is weaker across platforms than within the same platform; for the functionally similar apps, the evidence on spillover of exposure is weaker than that for the other two groups, and the spillover of quality endorsement is statistically insignificant. In addition, we also find that the strength of the spillover effect depends on the salient characteristics of the featured apps such as price and user rating. ',\n",
       " \"WeChat, an instant messaging app, is considered a mega app because of its dominance in terms of use among Chinese smartphone users. A major concern for such an app is whether its increasing usage would crowd out the usage of other apps in the broader app market. This study estimates the spillover effects of WeChat on the other top 50 most frequently used apps in China, using users' weekly app usage data. Given the challenge of determining causal inference from observational data, this study borrows a machine-learning method and integrates it with econometrics. We find that WeChat does not crowd out the other apps' use. In fact, only two other apps, Tencent News and Taobao, are affected by WeChat usage causally, and interestingly, both receive positive spillover effects as a result of the complementary effects. This finding alleviates concerns about the threat by WeChat and indicates that WeChat's success is not in exchange for squeezing out the use of other major apps. Instead, WeChat might contribute to the platform by transforming users' nonmobile activities to the mobile setting and by exhibiting some positive spillovers. In addition, this study shows the strength of graphical models in identifying causal relationships from observational data. WeChat, an instant messaging app, is considered a mega app because of its dominance in terms of use among Chinese smartphone users. Little is known, however, about its externality in the broader app market. This work estimates the spillover effects of WeChat on the other top 50 most frequently used apps in China, using users' weekly app usage data. Given the challenge of determining causal inference from observational data, we apply a graphical model and an econometric method to estimate the spillover effects in two steps: (1) we determine the causal structure by estimating a partially ancestral diagram, using a fast causal inference algorithm; and (2) given the causal structure, we find a valid adjustment set and estimate the causal effects by an econometric model with the adjustment set for controlling noncausal effects. Our findings show that the spillover effects of WeChat are limited; in fact, only two other apps, Tencent News and Taobao, receive positive spillover effects from WeChat. In addition, we show that if researchers fail to account for the causal structure that is determined from the graphical model, it is easy to fall into the trap of confounding bias and selection bias when estimating causal effects. The findings generate managerial implications in terms of app usage patterns, strategic management of mega apps on an app platform, and app promotional strategies for app platform managers and app developers. \",\n",
       " 'From an upset stomach to a life-threatening foodborne illness, getting sick is all too common after eating in restaurants. Although health inspection programs for restaurants are designed to protect consumers, such inspections typically occur sporadically, allowing restaurant hygiene to remain unknown for diners. At the same time, online reviews for restaurants provide a valuable source of information about the current status and quality of a restaurant. In this paper, we use the text contained in these reviews of restaurants to effectively identify cases of hygiene violations in restaurants, even after the restaurants have been inspected. Using data about restaurant hygiene in New York City from 2010 through 2016 and the associated set of online reviews for the same set of restaurants from Yelp, we use supervised machine learning techniques to develop a hygiene dictionary specifically crafted to identify hygiene-related problems. With this dictionary, we report systematic instances of moral hazard, wherein restaurants with positive hygiene inspection scores are seen to regress in their hygiene maintenance within 90 days of receiving the inspection scores. Based on these results, we provide strategies for how cities and policymakers may design effective restaurant inspection programs. From an upset stomach to a life-threatening foodborne illness, getting sick is all too common after eating in restaurants. Although health inspection programs are designed to protect consumers, such inspections typically occur at wide intervals of time, allowing restaurant hygiene to remain unmonitored in the interim periods. Information provided in online reviews may be effectively used in these interim periods to gauge restaurant hygiene. In this paper, we use textual information from online reviews of restaurants to effectively identify cases of hygiene violations in restaurants, even after the restaurants have been inspected and certified, thereby identifying moral hazard. Using a data set of restaurant hygiene inspections in New York City from 2010 through 2016 and the associated set of online reviews for the same set of restaurants from Yelp, we use supervised machine learning techniques to develop a hygiene dictionary specifically crafted to identify hygiene-related concerns. The use of this dictionary and the related word counts in online reviews allows us to identify systematic instances of moral hazard, wherein restaurants with positive hygiene inspection scores are seen to regress in their hygiene maintenance within 90 days of receiving the inspection scores. To the extent that social media provide some visibility into the hygiene practices of restaurants, we argue that the effects of information asymmetry that lead to moral hazard may be partially mitigated in this context. Based on our work, we also provide strategies for how cities and policymakers may design effective restaurant inspection programs, through a combination of traditional inspections and the appropriate use of social media.

       " 'If labor productivity varies in unknown ways over time, this could lead to unforeseen fluctuations in production or delivery rates, leading to stockouts or inventory build-up in a supply chain, while contributing to higher operating costs and to lower satisfaction levels for customers. The \"Monday Effect,\" that is lower productivity and higher error rates on Mondays compared with other days of the week, has been demonstrated in the finance and industrial relations literature. Using a database of 12 months of purchases from the General Services Administration (GSA) of the U.S. government (a key distributor of goods to government purchasers), we show that, indeed, performance is lower on Mondays compared with other weekdays in terms of order fulfillment and order cycle time. However, when purchasers use the GSA\\'s internet-based electronic market instead of using manual ordering procedures, the fulfillment gap between Mondays and other weekdays narrows considerably, demonstrating the value of information technology in smoothing distribution flows. By acknowledging the Monday Effect, distributors can thus plan for these weekly fluctuations and use information technology to improve service levels. Although there are both process-related and human-related grounds for systematic performance variations across days of the week, such a phenomenon has not caught the attention of information systems or operations management scholars. Using transaction-level data from the U.S. Government\\'s General Services Administration, we study three layers of effects: the Monday Effect, the Technology Effect, and the Product Effect. First, we assess whether performance varies across days of the week in supply chain fulfillment, measured by order cycle time, complete orders fulfilled, and short shipment percentage (i.e., the Monday Effect). Furthermore, we assess how information technology (IT), notably an electronic market, can mitigate such variations (i.e., the Technology Effect), and how product characteristics moderate such effects (i.e., the Product Effect). Our findings show that there indeed exist significant, systematic performance variations across days of the week, with Mondays having poorer performance than other days of the week, after controlling for workload and other factors. Further, we find that much of the performance variation can be reduced when an IT-enabled electronic market is adopted. Specifically, the performance gaps in order cycle time, complete orders fulfilled, and short shipment percentage are reduced by 94%, 71%, and 80%, respectively. We further find that IT improves not only the mean level, but also the variance, of operations performance. Finally, we find that the electronic market is most effective at mitigating the Monday Effect for less frequently transacted products, such as products of high value, products that are slow moving, and specialized products with small numbers of buyers. These findings suggest that measures can be taken to reduce fulfillment deficiencies, including using information systems to mitigate variations in operations management, leading, potentially, to operational continuity and higher service levels in the supply chain.

       " 'Cloud-service agreements entail the provisioning of virtual infrastructures at specified availability levels. The agreements specify the infrastructure prices and penalties borne by providers when assured availabilities are not met. Hence, backup resources should be optimally provisioned by balancing the provisioning costs with penalties. We develop stochastic dynamic optimization models of the backup provisioning problem by integrating methods from Operations Management, Statistics and Machine Learning, and Computer Science. We present two sets of dynamic provisioning strategies: periodic policies where resources are adjusted at regular intervals and aperiodic policies that allow flexible timing of such interventions. A closed-loop optimization model under conservative resource control and a certainty-equivalent optimization model under aggressive resource control are developed for periodic management. Similarly, we propose two strategies for aperiodic management: single intervention with single look-ahead and multiple interventions with single look-ahead. We develop computationally efficient online algorithms for both periodic and aperiodic models. We evaluate the models through computational experiments and validate with Amazon EC2 use cases. We provide cloud service providers practical guidelines for efficiently formulating flexible service agreements and cost-effectively managing the virtual infrastructure resources. The proposed resource optimization framework is most suitable to IaaS and can easily be extended to PaaS environments. A cloud service agreement entails the provisioning of a required set of virtual infrastructure resources at a specified level of availability to a client. The agreement also lays out the price charged to the client and a penalty to the provider when the assured availability is not met. The availability assurance involves backup resource provisioning, and the provider needs to allocate backups cost-effectively by balancing the resource-provisioning costs with the potential penalty costs. We develop stochastic dynamic optimization models of the backup resource-provisioning problem, leading to cost-effective resource-management policies in different practical settings. We present two sets of dynamic provisioning strategies: periodic policies, where resources are adjusted at regular intervals, and aperiodic policies that allow flexible timing of such interventions. A closed-loop (CL) optimization model under conservative resource control and a certainty-equivalent (CE) optimization model under aggressive resource control are developed for periodic resource management. Similarly, aperiodic resource management is modeled by using two different strategies: single intervention with single look-ahead (SISL) and multiple interventions with single look-ahead (MISL). Online optimization algorithms for both the periodic and aperiodic models are developed. The worst-case behavior of the algorithms is studied by using competitive ratio analysis and the expected behavior by using computational investigations. By using these studies, managerial guidelines for choosing the best resource-management strategy under different client-specific, service-specific, and system-specific resource-optimization conditions are presented. We validate our models based on use cases constructed from Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) with their actual pricing and service-credit data. The practical guidelines from this study will aid contract administrators in cloud data centers to both efficiently formulate service-level agreements and cost-effectively manage the virtual infrastructure resources committed in such agreements.

       " 'The open internet is plagued by congestion that restricts the development of sophisticated internet-based services. Broadband and edge providers have proposed a two-tier internet with a fee-based fast lane that coexists with the open internet. This requires a restriction of internet openness, also known as network neutrality, in the fast-lane internet. Opponents of a two-tier internet believe it would hinder innovation and cause underinvestment in the open internet. The challenge is for policy to balance a fee-based fast lane with the viability of the open internet. We find that edge providers with greater bandwidth requirements per unit of output convert to the fast lane and that the fast lane can drive innovation from edge providers with high bandwidth requirements. The broadband provider chooses fixed fee pricing for the fast lane but has no incentive to increase internet capacity as long as the open internet is not monetized. With no investments in internet capacity, all edge providers of the open Internet and their end users are worse off with a two-tier internet. To maintain quality-of-service in the open internet and to increase social welfare, a two-tier internet has to be coupled with policy whereby a portion of broadband provider profit is invested in internet capacity. The open internet is plagued by congestion that restricts the development of sophisticated internet-based services, as was predicted in early work on priority pricing. Broadband and edge providers have proposed a two-tier internet with fee-based prioritization of traffic in a fast-lane internet that coexists with the open internet to overcome these problems. Doing so restricts internet openness, also known as network neutrality, in the fast-lane internet. Opponents of a two-tier internet believe it would hinder innovation, motivate underinvestment in internet infrastructure, and, consequently, reduce the quality of service (QoS) of the open internet. The challenge is for policy to balance a fee-based fast lane for priority traffic and safeguard against the viability of the open internet. In our model, edge providers choose output levels and internet type; a broadband provider chooses investment in internet capacity and pricing for prioritizing traffic in the fast lane; and a policy maker chooses a mechanism for balancing openness and prioritization in a two-tier internet. We find that edge providers with greater bandwidth requirements per unit of output convert to the fast lane, which can drive innovation from edge providers with high bandwidth requirements. The broadband provider chooses fixed fee pricing for the fast lane but has no incentive to increase investment in internet capacity as long as the open internet is not monetized. So long as there are no investments in internet capacity, all edge providers of the open internet and their end users are worse off with a two-tier internet. To maintain the QoS of the open internet and to increase social welfare, a two-tier internet has to be coupled with a policy mechanism, whereby a portion of broadband provider profit is invested in internet capacity.

       " 'Does the task work orchestration in free (Libre) and open-source (FLOSS) software projects influence the project\\'s success? Does satisfying the psychological needs of the contributors effectively scale up to the level of the project and manifest as project success? For answers, we developed an innovative approach to operationalize and study the degree to which a project\\'s task work consisted of sequential layering of individually developed tasks, referred to as \"superposed organization of tasks.\" Using this measure on a large sample of FLOSS projects hosted on GitHub, we found that the degree of superposition exhibited an inverted U-shaped relationship with project success, indicating the presence of an optimal value for the project\\'s work structures. Further, organizational ownership of projects introduced practices that tended to influence the nature of this relationship. The greater the organization owner was willing to invest in the project by contributing code and employees\\' time, the lesser was the overall influence of superposed work structures on the success of the project. The greater the organization owner invested in the support activities of the FLOSS project, greater was the time-cost of money—creating a higher need for efficient development practices in lieu of superposition. Collaboration through open superposition describes the dominant work orchestration mechanism observed in free (Libre) and open-source (FLOSS) software, wherein the software development occurs by the sequential layering of individual tasks. This work orchestration mechanism is different from the traditional idea of software development, where the focus is toward cowork and concurrent development facilitated by a modular software design architecture. Our study theorizes and examines the motivational mechanisms that operate within superposed work structures to influence the success of FLOSS projects. We also unearth the contextual conditions that may limit the influence of the superposed nature of work on FLOSS project success. Furthermore, given the increasing use of FLOSS by organizations, we investigate the specificities brought to these motivational mechanisms when FLOSS projects are owned by organizations. The results from our analysis of over 6,500 FLOSS projects hosted on GitHub support a nonlinear relationship between the degree of superposition and the success of the FLOSS project. Moreover, we find that the type of ownership moderates this nonlinear relationship such that (1) organizational ownership mitigates the influence of the degree of superposition on the success of the project and that (2) under organizational ownership, the optimal degree of superposition (the point at which the success of the project is at a maximum) is lower than for individual-owned projects. This research advances our understanding of work structures, motivation, and organizational participation in FLOSS environments by describing the influence of task structures on the success of projects. The study also provides FLOSS practitioners with valuable insights for modeling project task structures to facilitate their success. ',\n",
       " \"Low engagement rates and high attrition rates have been formidable challenges to mobile apps and their long-term success. To date, little is known about how companies can scientifically detect user engagement stages and optimize corresponding personalized-targeting promotion strategies to improve business revenues. This paper proposes a new structural forward-looking hidden Markov model as combined with a randomized field experiment on app notification promotions. Our model can recover consumer latent engagement stages by accounting for both the time-varying nature of users' engagement and their forward-looking consumption behavior. The structural estimates from the FHMM with the field-experimental data enable us to identify heterogeneity in the treatment effects. Additionally, we simulate and optimize the revenues of different personalized-targeting promotion strategies with the structural estimates. Personalized dynamic engagement-based targeting based on the FHMM can generate substantially higher revenues than the experience-based targeting strategy applied by current industry practices and targeting strategies based on alternative customer segmentation models. Overall, the novel feature of our paper is its proposal of a new personalized-targeting approach combining the FHMM with a field experiment to tackle the challenge of low engagement with mobile apps. Low engagement rates and high attrition rates have been formidable challenges to mobile apps and their long-term success, especially for those whose revenues derive mainly from in-app purchases. To date, little is known about how companies can scientifically detect user engagement stages and optimize corresponding personalized-targeting promotion strategies to improve business revenues. This paper proposes a new structural forward-looking hidden Markov model (FHMM) combined with a randomized field experiment on app notification promotions. Our model can recover consumer latent engagement stages by accounting for both the time-varying nature of users' engagement and their forward-looking consumption behavior. Although app users in most of the engagement stages are likely to become less dynamically engaged, this slippery slope of user engagement can be alleviated by randomized treatments of app promotions. The structural estimates from the FHMM with the field-experimental data also enable us to identify heterogeneity in the treatment effects, specifically in terms of the causal impact of app promotions on continuous app consumption behavior across different hidden engagement stages. Additionally, we simulate and optimize the revenues of different personalized-targeting promotion strategies with the structural estimates. Personalized dynamic engagement-based targeting based on the FHMM can, compared with nonpersonalized mass promotion, generate 101.84% more revenue for the price promotion and 72.46% more revenue for the free-content promotion. It also can generate substantially higher revenues than the experience-based targeting strategy applied by current industry practices and targeting strategies based on alternative customer segmentation models such as k-means or the myopic hidden Markov model. Overall, the novel feature of our paper is its proposal of a new personalized-targeting approach combining the FHMM with a field experiment to tackle the challenge of low engagement with mobile apps. \",\n",
       " \"Every major e-commerce site recommends related products on a product's page. According to a McKinsey & Company retail report, 35% of what consumers purchase on Amazon and 75% of what they watch on Netflix come from product recommendations based on sophisticated predictive algorithms. This research points out two reasons for these inflated estimates. First, most recommendation algorithms identify products to recommend based on how frequently they are viewed or purchased together by a majority of consumers. Because of this, customers are most likely either already aware of or can easily discover similar products without recommendations. Second, most e-commerce websites offer sophisticated search and browsing tools that help consumers easily find products without recommendations. Therefore, attributing sales of those products to recommendations that consumers are already aware of or could easily discover with other tools on the retailer's website is not correct. We designed a large-scale experimental study on a major fashion retailer's website to find that recommendations increase the sales of recommended products by 9% but at the expense of a 1.9% decrease in sales of focal products, or the original products consumers viewed. Overall, product recommendations boosted product sales by 11%. We further found that recommendations didn't affect all products alike. More popular products that were linked to lots of other products got more of a boost, whereas less popular products actually had worse sales with recommendations. These findings inform the recommendation strategies of retailers and marketers, such as how to boost the sales of their products with its sponsored recommendations of another product's page. Recommending substitute products on focal products' pages on an e-commerce website can impact product sales in two ways. First, the visibility of a product as a recommendation on other products' pages may increase its exposure and result in a greater number of its page views. Second, visibility of substitute products on the product's page may cannibalize its own sales while resulting in greater exposure for the substitute products. The net impact of these opposing effects is unclear. We conduct a randomized experiment on a fashion apparel retailer's website to answer the following questions: (1) what is the causal value of recommendation links from a product to its recommended products in terms of the additional sales for both the product and its recommended products, and (2) how does the value of a product's recommendation links vary based on its network characteristics, such as its PageRank and the strength of its relationship with neighboring products? We find that as a result of a recommendation, on average, (1) the daily number of product page views increased by 7.5%, and (2) conditional on a product's page view, its sales decreased by 1.9%, and the sales of its recommended substitutes increased by 9%. On average, recommendation links of a product result in an 11% gain in total sales of the product and its recommended substitutes. However, these gains are not evenly distributed among all products. We find that although the number of page views for a product is positively affected by the number and strength of its incoming links, its sales (its recommended products' sales) conditional on its page view are negatively (positively) affected by the strength of its outgoing links. We conduct policy simulations to highlight how retailers and producers can apply this knowledge by engineering the recommendation network through sponsored links. \",\n",
       " \"With the growth and prevalence of social media platforms, many companies have been using them to engage with customers and encourage user-generated content about their products and services. In this paper, we analyze user-generated posts from the Facebook business pages of multiple companies across several industries to understand what users post on Facebook business pages and how post valence and content characteristics affect engagement, measured as the number of likes and comments received by a post. Our analysis demonstrates that negative posts are significantly more prevalent than positive posts, and negative posts also tend to attract more likes and more comments than positive posts. Importantly, engagement depends not only on the valence of a post but also on the specific post content. We observe three types of customer complaints respectively related to product and service quality, money issues, and corporate social responsibility issues. We show that social complaints receive more likes, but fewer comments, than quality or money complaints. Our findings reveal the practical challenges of managing Facebook business pages as a new channel of interacting with customers, and they highlight the need to explore effective response strategies to manage customer complaints and other service requests on social media. With the growth and prevalence of social media platforms, many companies have been using them to engage with customers and encourage user-generated content (UGC) about their products and services. However, there has not been much research on the characteristics of UGC on these platforms and, correspondingly, their impact on customer engagement. In this paper, we analyze user-generated posts from Facebook business pages of multiple companies to understand what users post on Facebook business pages and how post valence and content characteristics affect engagement, measured as the number of likes and comments received by a post. We control for a variety of factors, including post linguistic features, poster characteristics, and post context heterogeneity. Our analysis demonstrates that for user-generated posts on Facebook business pages, negative posts are significantly more prevalent than positive posts, which contrasts with the J-shaped valence distribution of online consumer reviews. We also show that engagement depends not only on the valence of a post but also on the specific ways in which a post is positive or negative. We observe three types of customer complaints, respectively, related to product and service quality, money issues, and social and environmental issues. Our analyses show that social complaints receive more likes, but fewer comments, than quality or money complaints. Such nuances can only be uncovered by analyzing the actual post content, going beyond the valence of the posts. Furthermore, we theoretically discuss and empirically demonstrate that liking and commenting are engagement behaviors with different antecedents. For example, positive posts tend to attract more likes yet fewer comments than neutral posts. Overall, our research shows that user-generated posts on Facebook business pages represent a distinctive form of UGC that is conceptually different from online consumer reviews. Our work advances the knowledge on UGC and has practical implications for firms' social media marketing strategy. \",\n",
       " 'This study provides new insights on compensation and human resources practices of multinational corporations (MNCs) and how they differ from those of domestic companies. The authors focus on cross-geography differences in compensation for IT professionals and take a closer look at returns on master of business administration (MBA) education and information technology (IT) experience. They analyze data on more than 20,000 IT professionals across the United States and India and compare practices of United States–based MNCs and India-based firms for IT professionals in India and of United States–based MNCs for IT professionals in the United States and India. The study finds that MNCs source IT talent from emerging markets because of the lower cost of IT professionals in these markets, coupled with the availability of a large pool of technically qualified professionals. For IT professionals in India, results indicate that United States–based MNCs pay a premium (compared with India firms) for each year of IT experience. By contrast, India firms pay a premium (compared with United States–based MNCs) for IT professionals in India with an MBA. Interestingly, whereas United States–based MNCs do not pay a premium for MBA education in India, they do pay a premium for MBA education in the United States. The findings are informative for IT professionals to decide whether to pursue an MBA or invest in gaining firm-specific experience. The results also provide indirect evidence that MNCs apply a portfolio approach to optimize their profits by using knowledge workers in various locations based on their skills and costs. How do multinational corporations (MNCs) and domestic firms compensate technical and managerial skills of knowledge workers within and across geographies? This paper answers this question by examining how developed economy MNCs and emerging economy firms value master of business administration (MBA) education and firm-specific information technology (IT) experience of IT professionals in India and how developed economy MNCs value MBA education and firm-specific IT experience differently across India and the United States. Our analyses of archival data on more than 20,000 IT professionals reveal two important findings. First, for IT professionals in India, the marginal effect of firm-specific IT experience on compensation is greater for developed economy MNCs than for emerging economy firms, and the marginal effect of MBA education is greater for emerging economy firms than for developed economy MNCs. Second, when we compare compensation of IT professionals employed by MNCs across India and the United States, we find a greater marginal effect of firm-specific IT experience in India but a greater marginal effect of MBA education in the United States. These findings suggest that the manner in which MNCs and emerging economy firms value and compensate IT professionals across geographies is consistent with their firm-level strategies and capabilities. The findings provide important insights on compensation of IT professionals within and across geographies based on firm national origin. These contributions are important to understand the broader context of compensation of IT professionals across firm national origin and geographies. ',\n",
       " \"In social media, ties between content providers as an organic recommendation mechanism enable users to explore content. A provider can initiate outgoing ties to other providers to cross-promote their content. On receiving the incoming ties, these responding providers then decide whether to reciprocate. Confirming that reciprocation is beneficial for the initiator to attract more subscribers, we find that the reciprocation benefit is negatively moderated by content similarity between the two providers and their common ties with other providers, although both content similarity and common ties increase reciprocation probability. Specifically, a 10% increase in content similarity decreases the reciprocation benefit by 27.2%, and one additional common tie reduces the reciprocation benefit by 12.6% on average. Therefore, providers can take different networking strategies for different objectives. New providers aiming for more reciprocations can initiate ties to providers with similar content or more common ties, whereas well-established providers can reach out to providers with fewer common ties to gain subscribers or to providers with similar content to grow views. To maximize the expected benefit of integrating both reciprocation probability and benefit, a provider should link to more content-similar providers among those with few common ties and more content-different providers among those with many common ties. In social media, a content provider can initiate outgoing ties to other providers to promote their content, thus inviting reciprocal promotion. We investigate how the reciprocation benefit for the initiating provider is affected by homophily and triadic closure, the two major mechanisms of tie formation. Specifically, we examine how the increase in subscribers and viewership of the initiating provider's content attributable to the responding providers' reciprocation is moderated by common ties and content similarity between the two linked providers. Using panel data on 27,356 YouTube video providers, we specify a switching regression model to estimate the influence of content similarity and common ties on reciprocation impact while correcting for their influence on reciprocation probability. Confirming that reciprocation is generally beneficial for the initiator, we find that although content similarity and common ties increase reciprocation probability, they reduce the reciprocation benefit for the initiator in terms of subscriber growth. We also find a positive interaction effect between content similarity and common ties on reciprocation impact, reducing their individual effects. Combining their respective influence on reciprocation probability and benefit, we further examine how content similarity and common ties affect the expected benefit for the initiator and derive practical implications for content providers and social media platforms. \",\n",
       " 'We propose a novel two-stage data-analytic modeling approach to gamer matching for multiplayer video games. In the first stage, we build a hidden Markov model to capture how gamers\\' latent engagement state evolves as a function of their game-play experience and outcome and the relationship between their engagement state and game-play behavior. We estimate the model using a data set containing detailed information on 1,309 randomly sampled gamers\\' playing histories over 29 months. We find that high-, medium-, and low-engagement-state gamers respond differently to motivations, such as feelings of achievement and need for challenge. For example, a higher per-period total score (achievement) increases the engagement of gamers in a low or high engagement state but not those in a medium engagement state; gamers in a low or medium engagement state enjoy within-period score variation (challenge), but those in a high engagement state do not. In the second stage, we develop a matching algorithm that learns (predicts) the gamer\\'s current engagement state on the fly and exploits that learning to match the gamer to a round to maximize game-play. Our algorithm increases gamer game-play volume and frequency by 4%–8% conservatively, leading to economically significant revenue gains for the company. We propose a novel two-stage data-analytic modeling approach combining theories, statistical analysis, and optimization techniques to model player engagement as a function of motivation to maximize customer game-play via matching in the large and growing online video game industry. In the first stage, we build a hidden Markov model (HMM) based on theories of customer engagement and gamer motivation to capture the evolution of gamers\\' latent engagement state and state-dependent participation behavior. We then calibrate the HMM using a longitudinal data set, obtained from a major international video gaming company, that contains detailed information on 1,309 randomly sampled gamers\\' playing histories over a period of 29 months comprising more than 700,000 unique game rounds. We find that high-, medium-, and low-engagement-state gamers respond differently to motivations, such as feelings of effectance and need for challenge. In the second stage, we use the results from the first stage to develop a matching algorithm that learns (infers) the gamer\\'s current engagement state \"on the fly\" and exploits that learning to match the gamer to a round to maximize game-play. Our algorithm increases gamer game-play volume and frequency by 4%–8% conservatively, leading to economically significant revenue gains for the company. ',\n",
       " \"How do virtual teams reach consensus when there is disagreement among team members and the consequences of making the wrong decision are high? To answer this question, the authors examine the daily chat room discussions and decisions of a virtual team responsible for air quality forecasting for the 5-million-person Atlanta region in the United States. They show that team members increase their use of visual representation technologies (VRTs), such as weather maps, during chat room discussions when the initial team consensus is low and the team is deciding whether to issue a smog alert that has large economic and health consequences. More use of VRTs in team discussions is associated with bigger shifts in the initial to final consensus forecasts of the team and greater likelihood that the team changes its forecast to issue a smog alert. Greater use of VRTs is not associated with greater forecast accuracy. Increased VRT use is also associated with greater imagery processing and increased group cohesion. For managers these results show that, in virtual team settings, some information technologies are associated with more persuasion than others and that training teams on the advantages and disadvantages of persuasive technologies is important. Although Fogg's ideas of persuasive technologies are widely accepted, few attempts have been made to test his ideas, particularly in a team context. In this article, we (1) theoretically extend Fogg's ideas by identifying contexts in which virtual teams are more likely to use persuasive technologies; (2) empirically measure technology visualness, a factor that likely makes technologies more or less persuasive; and (3) assess the association between the use of persuasive technologies, judgment shifts, and forecast performance in a real-world virtual team context. We identify visual representation technologies (VRTs) as a class of technologies used by virtual teams to select, transform, and present data in a rich visual format. We propose that such technologies play a persuasive, as well as diagnostic, role in virtual team decisions. Over a three-year period, we examine the daily chat room discussions and decisions of a virtual team that makes smog forecasts with large economic and health consequences. We supplement regression models of field data with an experiment, interviews with team members, and analyses of imagery processing and group cohesion in team language use. Experiment results show that, relative to non-VRTs, the use of a VRT in a forecasting task increases imagery processing. Field data results show that team members increase their use of VRTs during chat room discussions when initial team consensus is low and the environment is more exacting. Greater use of VRTs in team discussions relates to greater shifts in the initial to final consensus forecasts of the team and greater odds of the team shifting its forecast policy to issue a smog alert. Increased use of VRTs is associated with lower forecast bias but is not significantly associated with forecast accuracy. VRT use is also associated with greater imagery processing and increased group cohesion, as shown through language use. \",\n",
       " \"Although e-commerce has been around for more than two decades, it is still so relatively new to most consumers that they often draw parallel from the bricks-and-mortar world to make (sometimes illogical) inference about the online world. This study demonstrates how one such illogical inference can affect customers' price perception. Through a series of five experiments, we show that an online store with larger online product catalog space is perceived to be selling more expensive products, and thus customers who care more about quality (price) evaluate it more (less) positively. This is because customers have learned that large interstitial space among products in a bricks-and-mortar store is associated with high price, and they simply use this association without thinking that online space is not costly and should not signal high price. Therefore, when an online store is price oriented and would like to attract customers who place great importance on price, it should not present large space around their products in the product catalog. On the contrary, if an online store would like to attract customers who care more about quality, it should show a loose product catalog that is not at all costly but transmits a high-price store image. Previous research has shown that because offline store space is costly, customers tend to associate large interstitial space among products in a bricks-and-mortar store with high price. Drawing on consumer inference and signaling theories, the present research suggests this offline association could be overgeneralized to online contexts and lead customers to illogically infer high price based on large interstitial space among products in an online product catalog (i.e., online product catalog space, OPCS). We conducted five experiments to test whether and why OPCS affects customers' online store price perception and its downstream effect on store evaluation. Our findings indicate that (1) an online store with larger OPCS is perceived to be selling more expensive products (Study 1); (2) the effect of OPCS is due to offline–online overgeneralization rather than online learning, because either a reminder of offline–online differences (Study 2) or sufficient web design knowledge (Study 3) diminishes the effect of OPCS on store price perception, and only people who believe that large offline space is linked with high price show this effect (Study 4); and (3) customers who care more about quality evaluate a store with larger OPCS more positively, whereas customers who care more about price do the opposite (Study 5). These findings contribute to literatures on web design, price perception, consumer inference in e-commerce, and offline–online behavior transfer. We also discuss implications for practice and offer suggestions for future works. \",\n",
       " \"Crowdsourced online mean ratings of local businesses are increasingly being used to infer the market power of a business. An important consideration in making this inference is whether two identically rated businesses (e.g., 4 stars) encounter the same local competitive dynamics if they face contrasting local market competition. To analyze this, the authors combine demographic, socioeconomic, and Yelp restaurant reviews for 372 isolated markets in the United States. The empirical estimates demonstrate that an increase in overall competition—measured as total number of businesses in a market—leads to a broader range and to a decrease in the average of a market's mean rating distribution. This implies that two restaurants with equal mean ratings differ substantially in the way they are affected by local competition depending on whether they are located in a large or in a small market. For example, a larger market has proportionately more lower rated restaurants, whereas higher rated restaurants have relatively fewer comparable substitutes and face less competition in such a market. Therefore, restaurants with identical mean ratings should ideally be assessed differently if they operate across markets with dissimilar numbers of competitors. Crowdsourced online mean ratings of local businesses are increasingly being used to infer the market power of a business. An important consideration in making this inference is whether two identically rated businesses (e.g., 4 stars) encounter the same local competitive dynamics if they face contrasting local market competition. Stated differently, this requires investigating if the key distributional properties of mean ratings in a market change with competition. To this end, we combine demographic, socioeconomic, and Yelp restaurant review data for 372 isolated markets in the United States. Our empirical estimates demonstrate that an increase in overall competition—measured as total number of businesses in a market—leads to a broader range and to a decrease in the average of a market's mean rating distribution. The implication is that a larger market has proportionately more lower-rated restaurants, whereas higher-rated restaurants have relatively fewer comparable substitutes and face less competition in such a market. These effects are particularly pronounced when the analysis is limited to specific cuisine types where vertical differentiation is more natural or when we control for city-specific unobserved heterogeneity. Our findings highlight that practitioners and scholars using online mean ratings of businesses from disparate markets should account for the local market structure to judiciously analyze the relative market power of a business. \",\n",
       " 'Smartphones have become essential for functioning in society, but as more personal information is accessed, transferred, or stored on smartphones, users struggle to control the release of their information via privacy settings. To enhance their privacy, individuals must be knowledgeable about their smartphone and motivated to use the device\\'s settings. Therefore, we explore the roles of knowledge and motivation in affecting smartphone owners\\' use of settings to limit sharing of location-based information. The authors find that personal motivation is the strongest factor affecting such use, and the opinions of others do not matter. This is likely because of the personal nature of smartphones. Furthermore, privacy knowledge and individuals\\' perceptions of their abilities to use privacy settings also affect this usage. However, a privacy knowledge–belief gap exists by which people with high levels of privacy knowledge utilize less restrictive privacy settings when their confidence in protecting themselves is low. The combined lack of effect from social motivation and the importance of perceived and actual privacy knowledge suggest that asking parents, teachers, or \"important\" others to tell individuals how to better protect themselves is unlikely to give the intended results. Instead, we need to appeal to individuals\\' personal motivation and offer them training via experiential learning, such as games or educational apps. The omnipresence of smartphones means that more and more personal information is accessed, transferred, or stored on these devices. Smartphone users struggle to control the release of their information when smartphones are always connected, close at hand, and the privacy settings for individual apps are difficult to access. To have meaningful privacy in this context, individuals must be knowledgeable about their devices and truly motivated to make use of the device\\'s privacy settings. We draw from extant privacy literature, the self-efficacy theory, and the information–motivation–behavioral skills model to understand usage of privacy settings on smartphones through data from 334 iPhone users. Our findings indicate that personal motivation is one of the strongest determinants of utilizing privacy-protective settings, and social motivation is not significant. Furthermore, privacy knowledge and self-efficacy constructs (i.e., knowledge specific to the device\\'s privacy settings) determine one\\'s use of privacy-protective settings, but knowledge and self-efficacy about smartphone technology do not. An interaction effect also exists between privacy knowledge and privacy self-efficacy such that people with high levels of privacy knowledge utilize less restrictive privacy settings when their confidence in protecting themselves is low, but as their self-efficacy increases, they are more likely to use more privacy-protective settings. We label this the privacy knowledge–belief gap. ',\n",

The results shed light on the interplay between user-generated channels and event types, as well as the potential for more robust event modeling methods that go beyond basic mention models. Our analysis framework reveals that user-generated content channels can facilitate timelier detection of adverse events: on average, two to three years or earlier than commonly used databases. The inclusion of negative sentiment polarity in the models can further reduce false-positive rates. Additionally, we find social media channels provide higher detection rates but lower precision than do search-based signals. The search and web forum channels are timelier than Twitter. The proposed heuristic-based method attains markedly better results than do existing methods—with earlier detection rates of 50%–80% and far fewer false positives across an array of VoC channels and event types. The heuristic method is also well suited for signal fusion across channels. Our note makes several contributions to research. The results also have important implications for various practitioner groups, including regulatory agencies and risk management teams at product manufacturing firms. ',\n",
       " \"A prime example of an emerging two-sided market is the driverless vehicle industry, an industry that will get much of its software from one side of the market: specifically, application developers. Consumers stand at the other side of this market. To what extent will this marketplace reward both the industry itself and application developers for technological innovation? In modeling this first question and keeping in mind consumers' appetite for technological advances, we provide nuanced answers for executives in the driverless industry, application development firms, and government. This question speaks directly to what level of investment is optimal. Given that high government officials want to encourage the future growth of this vibrant industry, a second key theme of the paper is as follows. Should governments subsidize the focal industry or developers based on the extent to which they are innovative? Or should governments subsidize consumers? Our models conclude that subsidizing the industry is the overall best strategy followed by subsidies for consumers under certain other conditions. We find that it is not in the interest of society to subsidize application developers. Executives can use our models and results to fine tune to match their own circumstances with basic changes in our parameters. Information technology (IT) can transform societies, governments, and businesses alike. Technological innovation requires difficult but critically important strategic decisions. Making good decisions becomes even more challenging for platforms tightly linked to network externalities that are inherent in two-sided markets. Inspired by the driverless car industry, which is now receiving green signals from available technology and government policies, this study introduces a model of competing IT platforms that use a complementary physical medium. The aim is to understand the possible incentives for technological innovation to inform decision makers from both industry and government. Although the existing literature on two-sided markets focuses on platform pricing strategies for network expansion, it pays little attention to decisions that involve high levels of innovation. For this reason, the study investigates how platforms can strike a balance between these two decision alternatives, namely price and improved quality from innovation. This study examines the conditions under which platforms receive incentives to innovate in the presence of network externalities. We also examine how equilibrium is influenced by technological asymmetry between the competing platforms, and consumers' and service providers' multihoming (i.e., choosing between multiple options) behavior. We extend focus to a government policy perspective by studying how to subsidize innovations. Three different policies are considered: (1) subsidies for consumers, (2) subsidies for service providers, and (3) innovation-based subsidies for platforms. The scholarly and practical implications of our findings are discussed. \",\n",
       " \"In this research, we focused on one of the core issues associated with Information Technology (IT) project management, namely the tendency to inadequately manage project risks. Project managers (PMs) surely must know by now that risks can derail projects and that tools and techniques are available to support the risk management process. Why, then, do many PMs seem unable or unwilling to adequately manage project risks? We believe that answering this fundamental question requires gaining a better understanding of how PMs construe risks. To gain this understanding, we examined key activities associated with the risk management process from a CLT perspective to determine the impact of construal on the judgment and decision-making of IT PMs when it comes to managing IT project risks. We found that IT PMs with a concrete mental construal (1) identify a greater number of project risks; (2) perceive a greater potential impact of project risks; (3) perceive that more effort and resources are required for risk management; and (4) are less willing to enact risk responses than IT PMs with an abstract mental construal. We demonstrate that IT PMs' mental construal can affect activities that are important to risk management. Prior research has suggested that information technology (IT) project managers (PMs) often fail to take adequate steps to manage project risks and that this may contribute to the high failure rate associated with IT projects. Knowing when to pay attention to the trees versus the forest may play an important role in IT project risk management. We draw on construal level theory (CLT) to offer a fresh theoretical perspective on IT project risk management as it is uniquely suited to understanding why IT PMs may focus on the forest (abstract, high-level construal) or the trees (concrete, low-level construal). Specifically, we integrate CLT with IT project risk management and theorize how IT PMs' mental construal affects four key IT project risk management activities: (1) risk identification, (2) risk impact assessment, (3) risk response planning, and (4) risk response enactment. We recruited a total of 805 IT PMs for this research and conducted a series of four laboratory experiments. In our experiments, we found that seeing the trees is beneficial in risk identification, risk impact assessment, and risk response planning. Specifically, we found that a concrete (relative to abstract) mental construal of a project leads IT PMs to identify a greater number of risks associated with the project (Experiment 1), and a concrete (relative to abstract) mental construal of a project risk leads IT PMs to perceive a greater potential impact of the risk (Experiment 2) and to perceive that more effort and resources are required for responding to the risk (Experiment 3). In contrast, we found that seeing the forest is beneficial in risk response enactment in that an abstract (relative to concrete) mental construal of a risk response leads IT PMs to be more willing to enact the risk response (Experiment 4). \",\n",
       " \"Our paper shows that software-based patents can contribute significantly to the value of firms. Our paper provides managers with insights into how different types of software-based innovations affect firm value in market environments exhibiting different levels of competitiveness and dynamism. Using a large-panel data set consisting of 602 U.S. firms, we find that firms with a software patent portfolio having higher levels of explorative innovation orientation achieve higher market value in environments with high competitiveness and low dynamism. By contrast, firms with a software patent portfolio exhibiting high levels of exploitative innovation orientation achieve higher market value in low competitiveness and high dynamism environments. Although some practitioners are still skeptical about the value of software patents, we provide empirical evidence that a firm's software patents do contribute to firm performance, thereby helping practitioners to justify their investments in software innovation and assess the value of their software patents. Furthermore, our paper highlights key factors—both internal (i.e., innovation orientation) and external (i.e., environmental uncertainty)—that may affect the value of software patents. This can help firms formulate the appropriate innovation strategy for software patents that can lead to the greatest returns. Although software patents have been growing steadily since 1996, when the restrictions on the patentability of software were eliminated, their value and impacts on the firm's profits remain unclear and ambiguous. Drawing on the real options theory and the literature on exploration and exploitation, we develop a novel theoretical framework to assess the value of software patents. Moreover, we examine the impact of contextual factors related to the nature of innovation underlying firms' patent portfolios (exploitative versus explorative) and the environmental uncertainty (competitiveness and dynamism) on the value of software patents. Specifically, we examine the interaction effect of a firm's software patent stock and its innovation orientation on firm value in markets exhibiting different levels of environmental uncertainty. Based on a large-panel data set consisting of 602 U.S. firms, our results indicate that a software patent portfolio having higher levels of explorative orientation is associated with a higher firm value (as measured by Tobin's q) in environments exhibiting low dynamism and high competitiveness. By contrast, a software patent portfolio with higher levels of exploitative orientation is associated with a higher firm value in environments with high dynamism and low competitiveness. We discuss the implications for research and practice. \",\n",

We capture individuals' willingness-to-accept for a privacy disclosure in a series of randomized experiments that manipulate characteristics of a required privacy disclosure by altering the information context, the intended secondary use of the disclosed private information, and the requirement to disclose personally identifying information. We collect data from two populations (college students and Amazon Mechanical Turk workers) to aid with generalizability of our results. Across the experiments, we consistently observe null effects for each of the privacy factors. The results provide a unique perspective on privacy valuations by showing that results from prior research on simple privacy decisions may not translate to more realistic, complex privacy disclosure decisions that involve multiple factors. Our findings suggest that disclosing private information may be an all or nothing type of decision as opposed to an activation of individual factors proposed by prior literature as important in a multidimension private information disclosure. This study provides managerial insight into the possible evolution of online disclosure decisions, especially in settings that incorporate multiple disclosure dimensions. We investigate changes to the value that individuals place on the online disclosure of their private information in the presence of multiple privacy factors. We use an incentive-compatible mechanism to capture individuals' willingness-to-accept (WTA) for a privacy disclosure in a series of three randomized experiments. Each experiment manipulates characteristics of a required privacy disclosure by altering the information context, the intended secondary use of the disclosed private information, and the requirement to disclose personally identifying information. We collect data from two populations (college students and Amazon Mechanical Turk workers) to aid with generalizability of our results. As methodological checks to rule out lack of awareness in the participants, we first increase the saliency of the privacy disclosure characteristics in the second experiment and then require participants to watch a video on the potential consequences of disclosing private information in the third experiment. Across the three experiments, we consistently observe null effects for each of the privacy factors, with two population-dependent exceptions in the second study. Our participants do acknowledge the increased risk introduced by the experimental factors, and the increased saliency and awareness do lead to higher privacy valuations on average. However, there is no consistent manifestation as significant main effects for the three privacy factors. This is in contrast to prior research, which has found significant effects for each of these factors when studied separately. The results provide a unique perspective on privacy valuations by showing that results from prior research on simple privacy decisions may not translate to more realistic, complex privacy disclosure decisions that involve multiple factors.

       " \"In this paper, we examine information flow across two crowdsourcing communities and provide empirical evidence on how information obtained from a customer support crowdsourcing community can help individuals generate more novel, popular, and feasible ideas in an innovation crowdsourcing community. Our findings inform firms' decisions about whether to simultaneously host customer support and innovation crowdsourcing communities. Companies such as Dell and BestBuy simultaneously host customer support and innovation crowdsourcing communities. Yet many other companies host only innovation crowdsourcing communities. Our findings suggest that hosting both communities has benefits because a customer support community offers idea generators an opportunity to accumulate current needs information as well as to activate means information from their memory. This needs-and-means information enables idea generators to create high-quality new product/service ideas. Our findings further suggest that those firms that are already hosting two crowdsourcing communities could benefit by tracing individuals' activities more closely. By collecting data about individuals' microlevel activities in a customer support community, companies would be able to identify those individuals who have a higher probability of creating better ideas. By mobilizing those individuals, companies can increase the quality of ideas they obtain from innovation crowdsourcing communities. This study investigates how the information that individuals accumulate through helping others in a customer support crowdsourcing community influences their ability to generate novel, popular, and feasible ideas in an innovation crowdsourcing community. A customer support crowdsourcing community is one in which customers help each other develop solutions to their current problems with a company's products. An innovation crowdsourcing community is one in which customers propose new product ideas directly to a company. Because a customer support community provides information regarding customers' current needs and provides opportunities to help individuals activate relevant means information, we expect that an individuals' experience of helping in a customer support community enhances the individuals' new product ideation performance. By utilizing a natural language processing technique, we construct each individual's information network based on his or her helping activities in a customer support community. Building on analogical reasoning theory, we hypothesize that the patterns of individuals' information networks, in terms of breadth and depth, influence their various new product ideation outcomes in an innovation crowdsourcing community. Our analysis reveals that generalists who have offered help on broad topic domains in the customer support community are more likely to create novel ideas than are nongeneralists. Further, we find that generalists who have accumulated deep knowledge in at least one topic domain (deep generalists) outperform nongeneralists in their ability to generate popular and feasible ideas, whereas generalists who have accumulated only shallow knowledge across diverse domain areas (shallow generalists) do not. The results suggest that the ability of generalists to outperform nongeneralists in creating popular and feasible ideas is contingent on whether they have also accumulated deep knowledge.

       " \"The sale of virtual currency has become an important revenue source in the digital gaming industry. This paper analyzes the impact of this business model on players' gaming behavior, the game provider's strategies for virtual currency price and ad level, and social welfare. Our findings have important managerial implications for the gaming industry and policy makers. We find that when the enabling-power rate of virtual currency (i.e., how much players benefit from enhanced gameplay due to virtual currency generated per unit of playing time) is stronger, players have lower incentive to purchase virtual currency. Therefore, the provider should set a lower price to avoid losing too much demand. In the meantime, the marginal benefit of playing the game increases, and thus the provider should set a higher ad level to take advantage of this boosted marginal benefit for players when the base valuation of gameplay is sufficiently low. Finally, we demonstrate that offering in-game purchases of virtual currency as a new business model benefits society as a whole. Our findings suggest that regulators of the gaming industry should be less concerned about the risk of excessive gameplay for games that sell virtual currency compared with those that do not. Despite the growing popularity of in-game purchases of virtual currency in digital games, there is very limited formal research that studies this new business model. This paper builds on the neoclassical labor–leisure model to examine the impact of selling virtual currency on players' gameplay behavior, game provider's strategies, and social welfare. When the game provider offers virtual currency for sale, players have two options to obtain virtual currency— playing the game and purchasing virtual currency directly. We introduce a parameter—the enabling-power rate of virtual currency—to characterize the extent to which virtual currency generated in a unit of playing time can augment players' production of gaming leisure. We find that selling virtual currency reduces the playing time for certain heavy players, whereas it boosts certain light players' playing time. It may also lead to a larger player base allowing more people to enjoy the benefits of playing digital games when the enabling-power rate of virtual currency is sufficiently high. The game provider should charge a higher (lower) virtual currency price for a game with a relatively lower (higher) enabling-power rate of virtual currency. She should also set a higher (lower) ad level for a game with a relatively higher (lower) enabling-power rate if the game's base valuation of gameplay, that is, the valuation of gameplay independent of virtual currency, is sufficiently low. Finally, we demonstrate that selling virtual currency could lead to a win–win–win situation for the game provider, players, and society as a whole. It will alleviate the conflict of interest between the provider's goal of longer playing time to maximize her ad revenue from in-game ads and the social goal of reducing excessive gaming, especially for heavy players.

       " 'New models of information systems development (ISD) have emerged to accommodate distributed participation and large numbers of contributors. Crowdfunding extends distributed models by allowing members of the public to finance a project, bypassing or lessening the need for traditional investor-controllers. Backers lack most defined power relationships and control mechanisms available to traditional investor-controllers. Yet some backers still successfully assume the power to influence the projects they support. This challenges traditional notions of power and control in ISD. We thus study two famous crowdfunded cases to explore how power and control are attained in these projects. Findings show that backers do indeed collectively impose each of the same high-level control types as traditional investor-controllers, albeit the specific controls imposed may vary. Key to backers\\' power is their ability to construct a positive or negative public image around a project, a power for which they continuously battle among themselves. This uncovers important vulnerabilities in crowdfunding, many of which emerge when public perceptions of project failure are high. Under these conditions, backers may become increasingly assertive, which paradoxically causes owners to become less compliant. This study further identifies issues with attracting large numbers of backers, as power and control dynamics become increasingly unstable. Crowdfunding has emerged as a popular alternative to traditional funding, wherein project owners use web technologies to fundraise from members of the public (\"backers\"). The established models of control do not work for this new way of performing systems development, because of the number and diversity of controllers, the restriction of interaction to public online discourse, and the absence of defined hierarchical power structures. This study performs a critical discourse analysis of public online discourse from two famous crowdfunded systems development projects. It develops a framework for the study of crowdfunding control that incorporates the prominent role that power, informal control, and discourse play. The study shows that backers are empowered by their ability to construct a positive or negative public image around a project, and they use this power to impose a diverse portfolio of formal and informal controls. Findings reveal a fundamental vulnerability in crowdfunding, as public perceptions of failure push backers to become increasingly assertive and owners to become decreasingly compliant.

       " \"Crowd-based ideation contests facilitate solution-seeking firms (seekers) to address their problems by soliciting ideas from external individuals (solvers). In this study, we examine how seekers' involvement—particularly in terms of the exemplars and prizes that they provide—shape the ideation process and outcomes in such contests. Although seekers' decisions about the exemplars to show and prizes to offer may be independent from one another, we show that certain aspects of these decisions jointly impact the extent to which solvers adopt seekers' exemplars in their ideas. This finding demonstrates that individual facets of seeker involvement could intertwine and have intricate effects on solvers right from the initiation of the contests. We further show that, by influencing solvers' exemplar adoption, seekers can also affect the effectiveness of the ideas. All in all, our results indicate that seekers acquire ideas not just through the crowd but also with the crowd, and they play an active role in how and what solvers ideate. Instead of simply delegating idea generation to solvers, seekers should thus share the onus of ideation and be aware of the impacts of their involvement in contests. To benefit from the wisdom of the crowd in ideation contests, seekers should understand how their involvement affects solvers' ideation and the ensuing ideas. This present study addresses this need by examining the antecedents and consequences of solvers' exemplar adoption (i.e., use of solution exemplars that the seekers provide) in such contests. We theorize how the characteristics of seekers' exemplars (specifically, quantity and variability) and prizes jointly influence exemplar adoption. We also consider how exemplar adoption affects the effectiveness of the resulting ideas, conditional on solvers' experience with the problem domain of the contests. The results from a company naming contest and an ad design contest show that exemplar quantity and exemplar variability both positively affect exemplar adoption, but the effects are strengthened and attenuated, respectively, by prize attractiveness. The outcomes of a campaign using the ads from the design contest further show that greater exemplar adoption improves ad effectiveness (in terms of click-through performance) although this is negatively moderated by solvers' domain experience. We discuss the theoretical and practical contributions of this research to ideation contests. The online appendix is available at https://doi-org.udel.idm.oclc.org/10.1287/isre.2018.0810. \",\n",

A laboratory experiment revealed two major findings related to the benefits of sponsorship disclosure in enhancing users' perceived integrity of a biased RA. First, for users with high prior knowledge about the prevalence of sponsorships used by RAs in general, sponsorship disclosure can reduce users' perceived psychological contract violations of a biased RA and then increase users' perceived RA integrity. For users with limited such prior knowledge, the disclosure fails to reduce these perceived violations.

       " \"The adoption and usage of mobile devices have fundamentally altered users' experience in a multichannel world. With the rise of mobile channels, firms have designed thousands of campaigns and spent billions of dollars to motivate or even subsidize app adoptions. However, it is not clear whether and how firms can effectively increase customers' purchases through these induced adoptions. Using a randomized field experiment involving over 230,000 customers on a major daily deal platform, we investigate the differential impacts of offering incentives or information on customers' app adoptions and subsequent purchase behaviors. We find that the causal effect of induced app adoptions varies greatly depending on how customers are motivated. Although providing incentive encourages most adoptions, incentive-induced adoptions do not result in more purchases in the long run. In contrast, providing information leads to effective mobile adoptions that sustainably increase customers' purchases and overall profits for the firm. We further identify a complementary effect between mobile app and desktop channels for information-induced app adopters, because the app serves as a deal discovery tool for them. Finally, we find that information works as a sorting device and attracts customers who have a greater need for the app and use it more effectively. Prior literature has established a positive association between mobile app adoptions and customers' purchase behaviors. However, it is not clear whether and how firms can actively influence customers' mobile app adoptions and increase their purchases through these induced adoptions. Using a randomized field experiment involving over 230,000 customers, we investigate the differential impacts of offering incentives or information on customers' mobile app adoptions and subsequent purchase behaviors. We find that (1) providing monetary incentives and providing information can both lead to a significant increase in mobile app adoptions and that (2) the causal effect of induced mobile app adoptions varies greatly depending on how customers are motivated. Although providing monetary incentives leads to a larger increase in mobile app adoptions, such incentive-induced adoptions do not result in more purchases in the long run. In contrast, providing information leads to effective mobile adoptions that sustainably increase customers' purchases and overall profits for the firm. In further examining customers' multichannel purchase behaviors, we find that there is a complementary effect between the mobile app and the desktop channel for information-induced app adopters but a substitution effect between the mobile app and the mobile web channel for incentive-induced app adopters. For information-induced app adopters, the mobile app serves as a discovery tool and helps them find a greater variety of deals. Finally, in exploring the underlying drivers of such differences in the effect of induced adoptions, we find that information compared with incentives serves as a better sorting device and can attract customers who have a greater need for the app and use it more effectively. Our findings provide actionable insights to firms on designing interventions to motivate effective mobile adoptions.

       " \"It is well accepted that the information technology (IT) industry is highly volatile, where incumbent firms are often disrupted by startups entering their product or service markets. This creative destruction is driven by large-scale movements within the entrepreneurial ecosystem, consisting of startups, venture capitalists, and innovators. These collectively represent the threat of new entry for incumbents, leading to turbulence in the future and necessitating a strategic response. Quantifying these risks of new entry threats (NETs) has always been problematic given their probabilistic and forward-looking nature. Taking advantage of text analytics, we develop a text-based measure of NET based on the extent to which a firm's description of its product markets overlaps with business descriptions of entrepreneurial firms backed by venture capitalists. This measure is then used to investigate how IT firms respond to NET through preemptive investments in research and development (R&D). We show that incumbents actually reduce R&D spending, on average, when facing high NET, consistent with risk aversion and financial conservatism. However, firms operating in contexts where high NET is unlikely to change market structure are likely to be more aggressive with their R&D spending—these contexts include markets with winner-takes-all dynamics because of strong network effects and those where the success of R&D effort hinges on the relevant continuities with prior innovative activities. The threats of new entry by startups in the fast-moving information technology (IT) industry have important implications for firm decision making. Although analytical work on the strategic responses to new entry threats (NETs) through preemptive research and development (R&D) has produced contradictory predictions, empirical analysis of this relationship is limited, largely because of the absence of a reasonable measure. In this work, we make two contributions. First, we develop and validate a measure of these threats through text mining using product descriptions provided by incumbent firm 10-K filings and business descriptions provided by startups. This novel measure of NET differs significantly from observed entry and competition. Second, we study the R&D investment strategies of IT firms facing new entry threats. Using a sample of U.S. IT firms over the period 1997–2013, we show that incumbents on average reduce R&D spending when there are greater threats from the startup space. More importantly, we show that the effect is not uniform—firms that operate in industries with strong network effects or high levels of technological cumulativeness invest relatively more in R&D when they face greater NET. Our work adds to the literature on the relationship between product market threats and firm decision making by expanding the scope of this line of work to include the role of threats of new entry—a central construct in the field of strategy and industrial organization—and by highlighting conditions that influence the effectiveness of preemptive R&D investments as a response to NET in the IT industry.

       " 'We examine the dynamic inventory liquidation problem, in which a retailer liquidates a fixed number of identical items over a time period by strategically setting prices periodically according to knowledge about stochastic demand. We propose to solve the liquidation problem by deriving a deterministic representation of stochastic demand. Assuming that customer arrival and valuations follow known statistical distributions (e.g., estimated from past transaction data), the expected arrivals and expected order statistics of valuation distributions represent informative and advantageous approximations of demand. Under the deterministic demand representation, we develop a greedy heuristic for finding the optimal liquidation strategy that result in maximum total revenue. The heuristic approach is computationally highly efficient and provides optimal solutions under deterministic demand representation when customer valuation follows various typical statistical distributions. Compared with two simple and commonly used liquidation strategies (i.e., the fixed-price strategy and the fixed-quantity strategy), our heuristic yields higher liquidation revenue. Compared with sophisticated approaches that can find optimal liquidation strategies under stochastic demand (e.g., stochastic dynamic programming), our approach runs several magnitudes faster and still yields near optimal expected revenue. Therefore, the heuristic approach can serve as a useful tool for managers to make liquidation-related decisions in realistic, stochastic demand scenarios. We develop efficient computational strategies for the inventory liquidation problem, which is characterized by a retailer disposing of a fixed amount of inventory over a period of time. Liquidating end-of-cycle products optimally represents a challenging problem owing to its inherent stochasticity. The growing scale of liquidation problems further increases the need for solutions that are revenue- and time-efficient. We propose to address the inventory liquidation problem by deriving deterministic representations of stochastic demand, which provides significant theoretical and practical benefits as well as an intuitive understanding of the problem and the proposed solution. First, this paper develops a dynamic programming approach and a greedy heuristic approach to find the optimal liquidation strategy under deterministic demand representation. Importantly, we show that our heuristic approach is optimal under realistic conditions and is computationally less complex than dynamic programming. Second, we explore the relationships between liquidation revenue and several key elements of the liquidation problem via both computational experiments and theoretical analyses. We derive multiple managerial implications and demonstrate how the proposed heuristic approach can serve as an efficient decision support tool for inventory managers. Third, under stochastic demand, we conduct a comprehensive set of simulation experiments to benchmark the performance of our proposed heuristic approach with alternatives, including other simple approaches (e.g., the fixed-price strategy) as well as advanced stochastic approaches (e.g., stochastic dynamic programming). In particular, we consider a strategy that uses the proposed greedy heuristic to determine prices iteratively throughout the liquidation period. Computational experiments demonstrate that such iterative strategy stably produces higher total revenue than other alternatives and produces near-optimal total revenue in expectation while maintaining significant computational efficiency, compared with advanced techniques that solve the liquidation problem directly under stochastic demand. Our work advances the computational design for inventory liquidation and provides practical insights. The online supplement is available at https://doi-org.udel.idm.oclc.org/10.1287/isre.2018.0819.

       " \"Are individual consumers forward looking in consuming mobile data volume every day, subject to a monthly quota limit? If so, how can mobile carriers easily identify these forward-looking users and design profitable promotions targeting these users? We discover distinct temporal usage patterns that can distinguish forward-looking users from myopic ones. An empirical test is constructed to test for individual forward-looking behavior and applied to a unique data set of individual mobile data users' daily usage volume over multiple months. We find a considerable proportion of users (about 40%) are indeed forward looking and also find empirical evidence of individual consumer myopia. Our dynamic structural model enables sophisticated counterfactual simulations incorporating various factors (e.g., consumer anticipation, plan switch) to deliver rich implications for targeted promotion design. As we find, promotions targeting only forward-looking consumers could be significantly more profitable than blanket promotions uniformly applied to all. Properly designed end-of-month promotions targeting forward-looking users could help mobile carriers fully utilize the otherwise excess network bandwidth and increase revenue at little extra cost. This paper examines the dynamic consumption behavior of individual mobile data users by employing a unique data set on individual-level daily usage over multiple months. Whether and which individual mobile data users are forward looking by dynamically balancing present and future usage and how to design profitable promotions targeting these users are questions of both academic and managerial interest. By developing a dynamic structural model and formally proving its theoretical properties, we discover distinct temporal usage patterns that can distinguish forward-looking users from myopic ones. An empirical test is constructed to test for individual forward-looking behavior by matching the observed usage patterns with the theoretical results. We find a considerable proportion of users (about 40%) are indeed forward looking and also find empirical evidence of individual consumer myopia. Our approach enables us to apply the dynamic model only to those exhibiting forward-looking behavior. It hence serves as a feasible option to control for consumer myopia in estimating dynamic structural models given the inherent limitation that individual discount factors are generally unidentifiable. Our structural model is shown to accurately capture the dynamic trends observed in the actual usage data. It enables sophisticated counterfactual simulations incorporating various factors (e.g., consumer anticipation, plan switch) to deliver rich implications for targeted promotion design. As we find, promotions targeting only forward-looking consumers could be significantly more profitable than blanket promotions uniformly applied to all.

       " \"Why do users engage in digital piracy? The theoretical explanations are particularistic and the empirical findings are fragmented and divergent. Managers and academics have thus had little guidance on how to explain and combat digital piracy. To help fill this gap, the present paper provides a meta-analysis that synthesizes past research and identifies the key drivers of users' engagement in digital piracy. The findings identify new measures and revise existing strategies to confront the global threat of digital piracy. Effective anti-piracy measures focus on breaking habits, reducing users' control, suppressing justifications, and changing attitudes. Breaking habits requires technical control strategies such as impeding access to pirate sites, and should be accompanied by legislative demands. Impairing the attractiveness of pirate websites while providing high quality content on legitimate channels weakens illegal users' perceived control. Enhanced features and functionality of legal products and websites that are easy accessible strengthens legal users' perceived control. While many existing anti-piracy campaigns foster positive appeals (e.g., supporting the industry), describing the risks and loss of control seem more promising. As for targeting, psychographics provide a better portrait of pirating users than demographics—they appreciate sharing, are innovative, less risk averse, less susceptible to influence, and of lower integrity. Finally, making more legal copies available to users is discouraged. Many studies have investigated why users engage in digital piracy. The theoretical explanations are particularistic, and the empirical findings are fragmented, sometimes divergent, and reveal unexplained variations of effects. Managers and academics have thus had little guidance on how to explain and combat digital piracy. To help fill this gap, the present meta-analysis synthesizes past research on digital piracy and accumulates 1,373 effect sizes from 174 studies collected in 36 countries. The meta-analysis identifies the key drivers of users' engagement in digital piracy and tests a new, comprehensive model that integrates all prior theoretical perspectives—social influence and control, outcome evaluation, dilemma solving, and reinforcement. The model explains 42%–53% of the variance in digital piracy attitudes, intentions, and behaviors and identifies the reinforcement perspective as the strongest theory. A moderator analysis shows that the influence of key drivers varies with cultural dimensions linked to the theoretical perspectives—individualism moderates social influence and control variables, masculinity moderates dilemma-solving variables, and uncertainty avoidance moderates reinforcement variables. These findings provide guidance for future digital piracy research and also have managerial implications in terms of possible revisions to antipiracy measures.

       " 'Practice-/policy-oriented abstract: Understanding why employees do or do not comply with information systems security (ISS) procedures is an imperative in today\\'s organizations whose futures often depend on how well they protect and harness information assets. We use a predominantly inductive approach to develop a theoretical understanding of how employees\\' reasons for engaging to ISS behaviors (ISSBs) change over time, using ideas from dialectics as our scaffolding. Our dialectical view of this process suggests that explanations for engaging in different ISSBs change over time as individuals seek to balance contradictory demands. Furthermore, our view suggests that new experiences and external events initiate a process of reevaluating tensions that can in turn lead to behavioral changes. Based on our observations and interpretation, we conclude that it is beneficial for ISS practitioners not only to be aware of factors that seem to promote compliance with ISSPs, but also to pay attention to the importance of opposing values and pressures, triggers, and ways to resolve the existing tensions related to an individual\\'s ISSBs. This will likely enable awareness about the dilemmas that individuals confront in ISS-related situations and potentially contribute to the design of better controls and procedures for ensuring compliant ISSBs. The various guidelines, procedures, and policies referred to as information systems security procedures (ISSPs) underlie information systems security behaviors (ISSBs) of many employees in organizations. Understanding the reasons for ISSBs—that is, why employees do or do not comply with ISSPs—is an imperative in today\\'s organizations, given that information is a valuable asset. In our study, we observed that employees\\' reasons for engaging in ISSBs, such as selecting a password, locking a computer, and using a USB memory device, changed over time. Noting that the dynamic nature of ISSBs has not yet received sufficient consideration in information systems security (ISS) research, we use a predominantly inductive approach to develop a theoretical understanding of the ISSB change process, sensitized by ideas from dialectics. Our dialectical process view suggests that explanations for engaging in different ISSBs are not static but change over time as individuals seek to deal with, or balance, tensions or contradictory demands. Furthermore, our view suggests that \"change triggers\" (e.g., new experiences and external events) initiate a process of reevaluating tensions that can, in turn, lead to changes in ISSBs. A number of implications for future research and practice emerge from this dialectical understanding of the ISSB change process.

From mobilizing the crowd in social movements to helping refugees settle into a new country, social media has had a significant impact. This study examines the role of social media in Congressional representation in a democratic political system. The authors study the impact of U.S. Representatives' Twitter adoption on their voting orientations in the 111th U.S. Congress. The authors find that Representatives' adoption of Twitter causes them to vote more in line with their constituents. Furthermore, the effect of Twitter adoption is more salient when a Representative's party differs from the party affiliation of the constituent or when the Representative represents a Twitter-savvy state. The results also indicate that the volume of tweets directed at Representatives signals the importance of certain bills to constituents. When Representatives vote on bills that are the focus of a large volume of constituents' tweets, Representatives vote in a manner more aligned with their constituents' opinions. Interestingly, the opinions the tweets express do not significantly influence their votes, suggesting that Representatives are aware of the potential bias in opinions cascaded in tweets. Social media has been found to be influential in a variety of contexts. From mobilizing the crowd in social movements to helping refugees settle into a new country, social media has had a significant impact. This study examines the role of social media in Congressional representation in a democratic political system. We intend to assess the impact of U.S. Representatives' Twitter adoption on their voting orientations in the U.S. Congress. In particular, we consider whether the adoption of Twitter by representatives makes them vote more in line with the political ideology of their constituents. We constructed a panel data for 445 members of the 111th U.S. House of Representatives across a period of 24 months. We exploited the variation in joining Twitter across representatives to identify the impact of joining and using Twitter on voting orientations. Using fixed effects and difference-in-differences approaches, along with propensity score matching to address potential endogeneity in representatives' Twitter adoption decisions, we found that representatives' adoption of Twitter causes them to vote more in line with their constituents. Furthermore, the effect of Twitter adoption is more salient when a representative's party differs from the party affiliation of the constituent or when Twitter use per capita is higher in the representative's state. To identify the underlying mechanism of influence, we conducted further analysis on one of the important issues in the 111th Congress. Our results indicate that the volume of tweets directed at representatives signals the importance of certain bills to constituents. When representatives vote on bills that are the focus of a large volume of constituents' tweets, they vote in a manner more aligned with their constituents' opinions. Interestingly, the opinions the tweets express do not significantly influence their votes, suggesting that representatives are aware of the potential bias in opinions cascaded in tweets.

       " \"Despite the average daily commuting time of commuters increasing by the day, the way marketers can benefit from our commuting behaviors has not yet been thoroughly examined. Commuting can serve as one of the most attractive contexts that mobile marketers can target not only because of commuters' high level of mobile engagement during long daily commutes but also because of its effortless and accurate identifiability. In collaboration with one of the largest global mobile service platform providers, this study investigates how contextual targeting with commuting is associated with responses to mobile coupons. The key findings indicate that commuters are about three times as likely to redeem their mobile coupon at a faster rate compared with noncommuters. However, multiple-coupon distribution strategy increases response rates more effectively among noncommuters than commuters. Moreover, the response rates of commuters and noncommuters are higher for coupons with shorter and longer expiration dates, respectively. The findings serve as useful guidance on who and which context to target, when to send mobile coupons, how many coupons to distribute, which coupons are more attractive, and what products should be advertised on mobile coupons. Despite the average daily commuting time of commuters increasing by the day, the way marketers can benefit from our commuting behaviors has not yet been examined. In collaboration with one of the largest global mobile telecom providers, this study investigates how contextual targeting with commuting impacts user redemptions of mobile coupons. The analysis is based on a rich field study in which 14,741 mobile coupons were sent to 9,928 public transit app users consisting of commuters and noncommuters. The key findings indicate that commuters are about 3× as likely to redeem their mobile coupon compared with noncommuters. However, a multiple-coupon distribution strategy is more effective in increasing redemption among noncommuters than commuters. Moreover, the redemption rate of commuters is higher for coupons with shorter expiration periods, whereas that of noncommuters is higher for coupons with longer expiration periods. On the basis of theories from psychology and physiology, we argue that stress, which is exacerbated by commuting, increases commuters' coupon redemption rate. We provide empirical support for this argument and show that marketers can increase response rates by focusing on specific periods of the day when commuting stress is relatively high (e.g., rush hours). By carefully exploiting commuting, which is easily identifiable and occurs throughout the world, managers may improve their mobile marketing effectiveness. \",\n",
       " \"How does consumers' price sensitivity at an online retailer change over time? And can we predict their response to price promotion by identifying the latent states of the online consumer–retailer relationship? Our quantification of transits across the consumer–retailer relationship states provides unique insights. For example, price promotion can strengthen consumers' loyalty only for at least moderately loyal consumers whereas it is not effective at changing nonloyal consumers' attitudes toward an online retailer (i.e., from nonloyal to loyal). Being opposed to the results from the off-line market, the consumers even in the strong relationship state are likely to seek more coupons as they increase their online shopping experience. The switching behavior observed even after online consumers reach the strong relationship state shows one aspect of the fierce price competition in the online market. Managers in online retailers pay attention to the recent change in a consumer's buying behaviors rather than the long-term trend of the consumer's purchase behavior. For instance, the increase of the recent purchase volume strengthens loyalty toward the retailer and/or the habit of buying without a coupon for the consumers in the strong relationship state. We aim to understand the attitudinal and behavior states of the online consumer–retailer relationship and its dynamics and, furthermore, to examine how consumers respond to price promotion as a function of the relationship. To do so, we build a hidden Markov model and estimate it with individual-level transaction data collected from a premier online retailer. Our quantification of transits across consumer–retailer relationship states provides unique insights. For example, price promotion can strengthen consumers' loyalty only for consumers who are at least moderately loyal whereas it is not effective at changing nonloyal consumers' attitudes toward an online retailer (i.e., from nonloyal to loyal). Unlike in the off-line market, consumers even in the strong relationship state are likely to seek more coupons as they increase their online shopping experience.

       " 'How to improve the predictive accuracy of box office revenue with social media data is a big challenge and is particularly important for movie distributors and cinema operators. In this research, we find that microblogging UGC (MUGC) is a significant predictor of box office revenue and has stronger predictive power than UGC on Douban! Movies (DUGC) based on our examination of 60 movies released in China in 2012. To increase the attendance rate of movies, cinema operators can consider previous valence and volume of MUGC before scheduling the current film screenings because these messages can quickly predict the future box office revenue of a movie. Besides, we find that the volume of enterprise microblogs (i.e., MGC) can predict both box office revenue and MUGC, indicating that movie distributors should optimize their online media strategy by shifting more resources to utilizing enterprise microblogging. Although rebroadcasting volume from microblogging platforms does not predict box office revenue directly, it can indirectly predict it via MGC. Accordingly, compared with third-party platforms, rebroadcasting as one of the key distinct functions of microblogging platforms also shows its usefulness in box office revenue prediction. Overall, metrics from microblogging platforms are more effective in predicting box office revenue than those from third-party platforms. In this research, we build a prediction model of movie box office revenue by empirically exploring its intricate relationships with user-generated content (UGC) as well as marketer-generated content (MGC) on a microblogging platform and UGC on a third-party platform. Our analyses are based on a panel vector autoregression (PVAR) model that is calibrated with a combination of data from Weibo (microblogging platform) and Douban! Movies (third party). Our empirical results show that microblogging UGC (MUGC) is a significant predictor of box office revenue and has stronger predictive power than UGC on Douban! Movies (DUGC). In addition, we find that the volume of enterprise microblogs (i.e., MGC) predicts box office revenue directly and also indirectly via MUGC, and MUGC thus exerts a partial mediating effect on the predictive relationship between the volume of enterprise microblogs and box office revenue. Finally, a prediction model of box office revenue using lagged box office revenue, MGC, MUGC, and DUGC is proposed, and its forecasting accuracy is found to outperform that of existing models.

       " \"The dynamic information technology (IT) market—characterized by frequent new releases, designs, and changing options—requires senior IT executives to look closely at new technologies while deriving long-term benefits from the firm's current technologies. This study focuses on the allocation of IT resources to new or current technologies, which is becoming even more important with tighter IT budgets. The results indicate that a joint consideration of a firm's core business strategy and organizational commitment to IT provides insights into whether the firm should emphasize new IT or current IT when allocating IT investments. With an increase in organizational commitment to IT, firms pursuing stable products/markets (i.e., Defender(s)) benefit more from current IT, whereas firms seeking new products/markets (i.e., Prospector(s)) benefit more from new IT. Finally, for firms seeking some stable products/markets and some new ones (i.e., Analyzer(s)), organizational commitment to IT does not influence the benefits from emphasizing new or current IT. This study initiates a line of inquiry on the factors influencing the value firms derive from new and current IT. Senior IT executives should carefully examine their firm's business strategy and organizational commitment to IT when prioritizing investments in new IT relative to the refinement of current IT. Senior executives seek investments in information technology (IT) initiatives that enhance the performance of their firms. They frequently must decide whether to emphasize the adoption of new IT (ENIT) or the maintenance and refinement of current IT (ECIT). This research examines how the combination of ENIT and ECIT with the firm's business strategy affects firm performance at varying levels of organizational commitment to IT (OCIT). Using the resource-based view, we argue that a firm can benefit from new IT or current IT to a greater extent when it possesses the resources needed for exploration (as is more likely for firms with a Prospector strategy) or exploitation (as is more likely for firms with a Defender strategy), respectively, with these effects increasing as the firm's OCIT increases. The results, based on an eight-year panel data set developed from multiple secondary sources, support our argument that firms are not homogeneous in the benefits they reap from ENIT and ECIT. Thus, a joint consideration of the core business strategy and OCIT in a firm provides insights into whether the necessary organizational resources are available and leveraged to effectively reap benefits from ENIT or ECIT. For Defenders emphasizing new IT, the marginal benefit decreases with an increase in OCIT, but for Defenders emphasizing current IT, the marginal benefit increases with an increase in OCIT. By contrast, for Prospectors emphasizing new IT, the marginal benefit increases with an increase in OCIT, but for Prospectors emphasizing current IT, the marginal benefit decreases with an increase in OCIT. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed. The online appendices are available at https://doi-org.udel.idm.oclc.org/10.1287/isre.2018.0798. \",\n",
       " \"Do solicitation sites lead to an increase in prostitution trends in United States? We shed light on this issue by examining the impact that Craigslist (via its Erotic Service section) has on prostitution incidence using a data set consisting of 1,796 U.S. counties from 1999 to 2008. Our analysis shows that prostitution levels increased by about 17% on average upon the introduction of the Craigslist. We find that the Craigslist has led to the increase in both independent sex workers and workers operating under commercial vice groups. However, it is the latter that is growing at a greater rate, which bears important implications for policies concerning sex trafficking. Craigslist's entry increases prostitution in both counties that have existing prostitution trends and those that do not, although the former set of counties experience a larger growth relative to the latter. Finally, we also found evidence suggesting that efforts in utilizing Craigslist for prostitution arrests are not catching up with the growth in prostitution trends induced by the site. In sum, online platforms can be utilized in unintended manners that facilitate illegal activities. Policy makers and website owners need to be aware of such impacts to implement the proper guidelines. The internet facilitates information flow between sex workers and buyers, making it easier to set up paid sexual transactions online. Despite the illegality of selling sexual services online, Section 230 of Communications Decency Act shields websites from liability for unlawful postings by third parties. Consequently, websites such as Craigslist have become a haven for prostitution-related ads. With prostitution-related sites still in operation, it is imperative to understand the link between these sites and prostitution trends. Specifically, in this paper, we quantify the economic impact of Craigslist's entry on prostitution incidence and identify potential pathways in which the website affects the sex industry. Using a national panel data set for 1,796 U.S. counties from 1999 to 2008, our analyses suggest that entry of Craigslist to a county leads to a 17.58% increase in prostitution cases. In addition, the analyses reveal that a majority of prostitution activity on Craigslist is induced by organized vice groups, in addition to voluntary participation by smaller set of independent providers. Further, we find site entry has a stronger impact in counties with a past history of prostitution and produces spillover effects in neighboring locations that are not directly served by Craigslist. Sex workers providing niche sexual services are found to increase with site entry. In addition, we learn that site entry leads to an increase in transactions of existing workers and also attracts new workers to the market. We find that the increase in prostitution arrests does not catch up with the growth in prostitution trends brought in by Craigslist. Finally, we find complementarity effects between erotic and casual sex ads in leading to the increase of prostitution. Our results contribute broadly to the emerging literature on the societal challenges associated with online intermediaries and internet penetration, and serve to provide guidelines for policy makers in regulating the sex industry in the internet era.

       " 'Recommender systems appear all across the internet. For e-retailers, this represents an opportunity to get more and niche products before customers\\' eyes. However, we find that while implementing recommender systems does increase overall sales figures, it does not generally improve the relative sales for niche items, leading to a rich-get-richer situation. We find, across a wide range of product categories, that the use of traditional collaborative filters (CFs) is associated with a decrease in sales diversity relative to a world without product recommendations. The decrease in aggregate sales diversity may not always be accompanied by a corresponding decrease in individual-level consumption diversity. In fact, it is even possible for individual consumption diversity to increase as aggregate sales diversity decreases. CFs help individuals explore new products, but similar users still end up exploring the same kinds of products, resulting in concentration bias at the aggregate level. There is one insight for management: Traditional collaborative filters carry the unintended consequence of increasing concentration bias. A firm interested in exposing consumers to a broader assortment of products may prefer a different design from another simply interested in maximizing sales. We investigate the impact of collaborative filtering recommender algorithms (e.g., Amazon\\'s \"Customers who bought this item also bought\") commonly used in e-commerce on sales diversity. We use data from a randomized field experiment run on the website of a top retailer in North America across 82,290 products and 1,138,238 users. We report four main findings. First, we demonstrate and quantify across a wide range of product categories that the use of traditional collaborative filters (CFs) is associated with a decrease in sales diversity relative to a world without product recommendations. Furthermore, the design of the CF matters. CFs based on purchase data are associated with a greater effect size than those based on product views. Second, the decrease in aggregate sales diversity may not always be accompanied by a corresponding decrease in individual-level consumption diversity. In fact, it is even possible for individual consumption diversity to increase while aggregate sales diversity decreases. Third, copurchase network analyses show that while recommenders can help individuals explore new products, similar users still end up exploring the same kinds of products, resulting in concentration bias at the aggregate level. Fourth and finally, there is a difference between absolute and relative impact on niche items. Specifically, absolute sales and views for niche items in fact increase, but their gains are smaller compared with the gains in views and sales for popular items. Thus, whereas niche items gain in absolute terms, they lose out in terms of market share. We discuss economic impacts and managerial implications.

       " 'Access to finance is arguably one of the most critical challenges in starting a new business. And people say that crowdfunding has the potential to democratize access to finance. In this study, we examine whether crowdfunding democratizes access to finance and, if so, how. To examine this, we obtained data on housing prices related closely to the cost of accessing bank loans and matched these data to a 2009–2013 novel data set from a leading crowdfunding market. We find an increased decline in housing prices leads to a significant increase in the creation of crowdfunding projects. However, we did not find significant differential effects in housing price changes between successful and unsuccessful projects. Finally, the effect of housing prices on crowdfunding projects was more significant for areas with low socioeconomic status. Interestingly, the increase in crowdfunding projects in these low-status areas was driven wholly by a significant increase in unsuccessful projects, whereas the effect of housing prices on successful projects was significant only in areas of high socioeconomic status. Overall, our study suggests that crowdfunding can supplement traditional sources of funding although socioeconomic status may still prevent disadvantaged people from receiving its full benefits. Access to finance is arguably one of the most critical challenges in starting a new business. In this study, we examine how the difficulty of obtaining bank loans based on housing collateral, which is a form of traditional finance, relates to crowdfunding use by entrepreneurs. We obtained data on housing prices related closely to the cost of accessing such bank loans and matched these data to a 2009–2013 novel data set from a leading crowdfunding market. We adopted the first-difference estimator to address unobserved area-specific effects and used housing supply elasticity as an instrument for housing price changes. We found an increased decline in housing prices leads to a significant increase in the creation of crowdfunding projects. However, we did not find significant differential effects in housing price changes between successful and unsuccessful projects.

       " \"Recent studies on the business impacts of information technology (IT) have examined these impacts in the context of either other organizational resources or contingency factors. In this study we integrate these perspectives to develop a contingent interaction model. This model examines how a firm's IT investment interacts differently with resources focusing on creating value (i.e., R&D) and resources focusing on value appropriation (i.e., advertising), depending on the environmental turbulence in the firm's industry. The results indicate that a firm's IT interacts differently with other organizational resources depending on (a) the resource's focus on value creation through innovation or value appropriation in the market; and (b) the extent of turbulence in the firm's industry. Thus, managers should consider IT's interactions with other resources while making IT investments. In turbulent and stable environments, managers should seek ways to use IT to complement R&D investments and advertising investments, respectively. Managers should also recognize that IT may erode some of the benefits of R&D and advertising investments in stable and turbulent environments, respectively. They should therefore exercise caution when making concurrent investments in IT and R&D in stable environments and exercise similar caution when making concurrent investments in IT and advertising in turbulent environments. Recent studies on the business value of information technology (BVIT) investments have focused on understanding IT's impact on firm performance, either in the context of other organizational resources or in the light of contingency factors. This study extends the prior literature by integrating these two perspectives and examining the BVIT while simultaneously considering other organizational resources and one important contingency factor—environmental turbulence. We develop a contingent interaction model, proposing that a firm's IT interacts differently with a resource focused on fostering innovation (i.e., research and development [R&D]) and a resource focused on enhancing the competitive gains in the market (i.e., advertising), depending on the extent of environmental turbulence in its industry. Specifically, we hypothesize that as the extent of environmental turbulence in a firm's industry increases, the positive effect of the interaction between IT and R&D investments on firm performance increases, but the positive effect of the interaction between IT and advertising investments on firm performance decreases. Our findings, based on a longitudinal sample of 294 firms observed from 1999 to 2008 and collected from three archival sources (InformationWeek, COMPUSTAT, and CRSP) provide evidence that supports the proposed hypotheses. Additionally, the results of a split-sample analysis reveal that the interaction between IT and R&D has a positive effect on firm performance in turbulent environments but a negative effect in stable environments. Conversely, the interaction between IT and advertising has a negative effect on firm performance in turbulent environments but a positive effect in stable environments. Put together, these findings indicate that a firm's IT interacts differently with other organizational resources depending on (a) the resource's focus on value creation through innovation or value appropriation in the market; and (b) the extent of turbulence in the firm's industry. This paper discusses the theoretical and empirical implications of these findings in detail. The online appendix is available at https://doi-org.udel.idm.oclc.org/10.1287/isre.2018.0803. \",\n",
       " 'With the availability of large-scale network data, peer influence in social networks can be more rigorously examined and understood than before. Peer influence can arise from immediate neighbors in the network (formally defined as cohesion or direct ties with one-hop neighbors) and from indirect peers who share common neighbors (formally defined as structural equivalence or indirect ties with two-hop neighbors). While the literature examined the role of each peer influence (direct or indirect) separately, the study of both peer network effects acting simultaneously was ignored, largely because of methodological constraints. This paper attempts to fill this gap by evaluating the simultaneous effect of both direct and indirect peer influences in technology adoption in the context of caller ringback tone (CRBT) in a cellular telephone network, using data from 200 million calls by 1.4 million users. Given that such a large-scale network makes traditional social network analysis intractable, we extract many densely connected and self-contained subpopulations from the network. We find a regularity in these subpopulations in that they consist either of about 200 nodes or about 500 nodes. Using these subpopulations and panel data, we analyze direct and indirect peer influences using a novel autoprobit model with multiple network terms (direct and indirect peer influence, with homophily as a control variable). Our identification strategy relies on a newly designed spatial autoregressive model, allowing us to identify the direct and indirect peer influences on each of the extracted subpopulations. We use meta-analysis to summarize the estimated parameters from all subpopulations. The results show CRBT adoption to be simultaneously determined by both direct and indirect peer influence (while controlling for homophily and centrality). Robustness checks show model fit to improve when both peer influences are included. The size and direction of the two peer influences, however, differ by group size. Interestingly, indirect peer influence (structural equivalence) plays a negative role in diffusion when group size is about 200, but a positive role when group size is about 500. The role of direct peer influence (cohesion), on the other hand, is always positive, irrespective of group size. Our findings imply that businesses must design different target strategies for large versus small groups: for large groups, businesses should focus on consumers with both multiple one-hop and two-hop neighbors; for small groups, businesses should only focus on consumers with multiple one-hop neighbors.

       " 'Design theories provide explicit prescriptions, such as principles of form and function, for constructing an artifact that is designed to meet a set of defined requirements and solve a problem. Design theory generation is increasing in importance because of the increasing number and diversity of problems that require the participation and proactive involvement of academic researchers to build and test artifact-based solutions. However, we have little understanding of how design theories are generated. Drawing on key contributions by Herbert A. Simon, including the ideas of satisfice and bounded rationality and reviewing a large body of information systems and problem-solving literature, we develop a normative framework for proactive design theorizing based on the notion of heuristic theorizing. Heuristics are rules of thumb that provide a plausible aid in structuring the problem at hand or in searching for a satisficing artifact design. An example of a problem-structuring heuristic is problem decomposition and an example of an artifact design heuristic is analogical design. We define heuristic theorizing as the process of proactively generating design theory for prescriptive purposes from problem-solving experiences and prior theory by constantly iterating between the search for a satisficing problem solution, i.e., heuristic search, and the synthesis of new information that is generated during heuristic search, i.e., heuristic synthesis. Heuristic search involves alternating between structuring the problem at hand and generating new artifact design components, whereas heuristic synthesis involves different ways of thinking, including reflection and learning and forms of reasoning, that complement the use of heuristics for theorizing purposes. We illustrate the effectiveness of our heuristic theorizing framework through a detailed example of a multiyear design science research program in which we proactively generated a design theory for solving problems in the area of intelligent information management and so-called big data in the finance domain. We propose that heuristic theorizing is a useful alternative to established theorizing approaches, i.e., reasoning-based approaches. Heuristic theorizing is particularly relevant for proactive design theorizing, which emphasizes problem solving as being highly intertwined with theorizing, involves a greater variety of ways of thinking than other theorizing approaches, and assumes an engaged relationship between academics and practitioners.

       " \"Crowd-funded markets have recently emerged as a novel source of capital for entrepreneurs. As the economic potential of these markets is now being realized, they are beginning to go mainstream, a trend reflected by the explicit attention crowdfunding has received in the American Jobs Act as a potential avenue for economic growth, as well as the recent focus that regulators such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have placed upon it. Although the formulation of regulation and policy surrounding crowd-funded markets is becoming increasingly important, the behavior of crowdfunders, an important aspect that must be considered in this formulation effort, is not yet well understood. A key factor that can influence the behavior of crowd funders is information on prior contribution behavior, including the amount and timing of others' contributions, which is published for general consumption. With that in mind, in this study, we empirically examine social influence in a crowd-funded marketplace for online journalism projects, employing a unique data set that incorporates contribution events and Web traffic statistics for approximately 100 story pitches. This data set allows us to examine both the antecedents and consequences of the contribution process. First, noting that digital journalism is a form of public good, we evaluate the applicability of two competing classes of economic models that explain private contribution toward public goods in the presence of social information: substitution models and reinforcement models. We also propose a new measure that captures both the amount and the timing of others' contribution behavior: contribution frequency (dollars per unit time). We find evidence in support of a substitution model, which suggests a partial crowding-out effect, where contributors may experience a decrease in their marginal utility from making a contribution as it becomes less important to the recipient. Further, we find that the duration of funding and, more importantly, the degree of exposure that a pitch receives over the course of the funding process, are positively associated with readership upon the story's publication. This appears to validate the widely held belief that a key benefit of the crowdfunding model is the potential it offers for awareness and attention-building around causes and ventures. This last aspect is a major contribution of the study, as it demonstrates a clear linkage between marketing effort and the success of crowd-funded projects. \",\n",
       " \"The Internet is making a significant transition from primarily a network of desktop computers to a network variety of connected information devices such as personal digital assistants and global positioning system-based devices. On the other hand, new paradigms such as overlay networks are defining service-based logical architecture for the network services that make locating content and routing more efficient. Along with Internet2' s proposed service-based routing, overlay networks will create a new set of challenges in the provision and management of content over the network. However, a lack of proper infrastructure investment incentive may lead to an environment where network growth may not keep pace with the service requirements. In this paper, we present an analysis of investment incentives for network infrastructure owners under two different pricing strategies: congestion-based negative externality pricing and the prevalent flat-rate pricing. We develop a theoretically motivated gradient-based heuristic to compute maximum capacity that a network provider will be willing to invest in under different pricing schemes. The heuristic appropriates different capacities to different network components based on demand for these components. We then use a simulation model to compare the impact of dynamic congestion-based pricing with flat-rate pricing on the choice of capacity level by the infrastructure provider. The simulation model implements the heuristic and ensures that near-optimal level of capacity is allocated to each network component by checking theoretical optimality conditions. We investigate the impact of a variety of factors, including the per unit cost of capacity of a network resource, average value of the users' requests, average level of users' tolerance for delay, and the level of exogenous demand for services on the network. Our results indicate that relationships between these factors are crucial in determining which of the two pricing schemes results in a higher level of socially optimal network capacity. The simulation results provide a possible explanation for the evolution of the Internet pricing from time-based to flat-rate pricing. The results also indicate that regardless of how these factors are related, the average stream of the net benefits realized under congestion-based pricing tends to be higher than the average net benefits realized under flat-rate pricing. These central results point to the fallacy of the arguments presented by the supporters of net neutrality that do not consider the incentives for private investment in network capacity. \",\n",
       " 'This paper starts from the premise that the simultaneous increase in environmental turbulence, the requisite speed of organizational change, and the intensified ubiquity of digital technologies are spawning a phenomenon that is messy, complex, and chaotic. Accordingly, we need to change the way we examine how information technology (IT) can help organizations build a strategic advantage in turbulent environments. We propose a more systemic and holistic perspective to theory building and testing in the information system (IS) strategy area and correspondingly appropriate methods that capture the complexity of this phenomenon. We term this phenomenon digital ecodynamics, defined as the holistic confluence among environmental turbulence, dynamic capabilities, and IT systems-and their fused dynamic interactions unfolding as an ecosystem. We believe that a more holistic understanding of digital ecodynamics will fuel the next leap in knowledge in the IS strategy area. First, extending the strategic management literature that has mainly focused on two-way interactions between environmental turbulence and dynamic capabilities, we foreground IT systems as a third central element. We use a \"threesome tango\" analogy with strong mutual interdependence to accentuate our view of digital ecodynamics-while also stressing the emerging role of IT systems in triggering environmental turbulence and shaping dynamic capabilities to build a strategic advantage. Second, we propose a different paradigmatic lens (configuration theories) as an appropriate inquiring system to better understand the complexity of digital ecodynamics. The paper articulates the key aspects of configuration theories as inquiring systems, compares them with the more common variance theories and process theories, and illustrates the power of recent advances in configurational methods. Third, we create a preliminary roadmap for IS researchers to better examine digital ecodynamics using novel structural properties afforded by configuration theories (i.e., mutual causality, discontinuity, punctuated equilibria, nonlinear change). Fourth, we reflect on the broader opportunities that the configurational perspective of digital ecodynamics can create for IS strategy research. The paper ends by highlighting the double-barreled opportunity that digital ecodynamics renders, both as an energizing vision for IS strategy research and also as a reshaper of strategic management research and practice in a turbulent and digitized world.

       " 'Organizations are increasingly engaged in competitive dynamics that are enabled or induced by information technology (IT). A key competitive dynamics question for many organizations is how to build a competitive advantage in turbulence with digital IT systems. The literature has focused mostly on developing and exercising dynamic capabilities for planned reconfiguration of existing operational capabilities in fairly stable environments with patterned \"waves,\" but this may not always be possible, or even appropriate, in highly turbulent environments with unexpected \"storms.\" We introduce improvisational capabilities as an alternative means for managing highly turbulent environments; we define this as the ability to spontaneously reconfigure existing resources to build new operational capabilities to address urgent, unpredictable, and novel environmental situations. In contrast to the planned role of dynamic and operational capabilities and the ambidexterity that they jointly offer, improvisational capabilities are proposed to operate distinctly as a \"third hand\" that facilitates reconfiguration and change in highly turbulent environments. First, the paper develops the notion of improvisational capabilities and articulates the key differences between the two \"reconfiguration\"—improvisational and dynamic—capabilities. Second, the paper compares the relative effects of improvisational and dynamic capabilities in the context of new product development in different levels of environmental turbulence. Third, the paper shows how IT-leveraging capability in new product development is decomposed into its three digital IT systems: project and resource management systems, organizational memory systems (OMS), and cooperative work systems—and how each of these IT systems enhances improvisational capabilities, an effect that is accentuated in highly turbulent environments. The results show that although dynamic capabilities are the primary predictor of competitive advantage in moderately turbulent environments, improvisational capabilities fully dominate in highly turbulent environments. Besides discriminant validity, the distinction between improvisational and dynamic capabilities is evidenced by the differential effects of IT-leveraging capability on improvisational and dynamic capabilities. The results show that the more the IT-leveraging capability is catered toward managing resources (through project and resource management systems) and team collaboration (through cooperative work systems) rather than relying on past knowledge and procedures (through organizational memory systems), the more it is positively associated with improvisational capabilities, particularly in more turbulent environments. The paper draws implications for how different IT systems can influence improvisational capabilities and competitive advantage in turbulent environments, thereby enhancing our understanding of the role of IT systems on reconfiguration capabilities. The paper discusses the theoretical and practical implications of building and exercising the \"third hand\" of improvisational capabilities for IT-enabled competitive dynamics in turbulence. ',\n",
       " \"As more and more firms seek to digitize their business processes and develop new digital capabilities, the enterprise systems software (ESS) has emerged as a significant industry. ESS firms offer software components (e.g., ERP, CRM, Marketing analytics) to shape their clients' digitization strategies. With rapid rates of technological and market innovation, the ESS industry consists of several horizontal markets that form around these components. As numerous vendors compete with each other within and across these markets, many of these horizontal markets appear to be crowded with rivals. In fact, multimarket contact and presence in crowded markets appear to be the pathways through which a majority of the ESS firms compete. Though the strategy literature has demonstrated the virtues of multimarket contact, paradoxically, the same literature argues that operating in crowded markets is not wise. In particular, crowded markets increase a firm's exposure to the whirlwinds of intense competition and have deleterious consequences for financial performance. Thus, the behavior of ESS firms raises an interesting anomaly and research question: Why do ESS firms continue to compete in crowded markets if they are deemed to be bad for financial performance? We argue that the effects of rivalry in crowded markets are counteracted by a different force, in the form of the economics of demand externalities. Demand externalities occur because the customers of ESS firms expect that software components from one market will be easily integrated with those that they buy from other markets. However, with rapid rates of technological innovation and market formation and dissolution, customers experience significant ambiguity in deciding which markets and components suit their needs. Therefore, they look at crowded markets as an important signal about the legitimacy and viability of specific components for their needs. Through their presence in crowded markets, ESS firms can signal their commitment to many of the components that customers might need for their digital platforms. Customers might find that such firms are attractive because their commitments to crowded markets can mitigate concerns about compatibilities between the components purchased across several markets. This unique potential for demand externality across markets suggests that ESS vendors might, in fact, benefit from competing in many crowded markets. We test our explanations through data across three time periods from a set of ESS firms that account for more than 95% of the revenue in this market. We find that ESS firms do reap performance benefits by competing in crowded markets. More importantly, we find that they can enhance their benefits from crowded markets if they face the same competitors in multiple markets, thereby increasing their multimarket contact with rivals. These results have interesting implications not just for understanding competitive conduct in the ESS industry but also in many of the emerging digital goods industries where the markets have similar competitive characteristics to the ESS industry. Our ideas complement emerging ideas about platform models of competition in the digital goods industry and provide important directions for future research. \",\n",
       " \"This study examines why firms fail or survive in the volatile software industry. We provide a novel perspective by considering how software firms' capabilities and their competitive actions affect their ultimate survival. Drawing on the resource-based view (RBV), we conceptualize capabilities as a firm's ability to efficiently transform input resources into outputs, relative to its peers. We define three critical capabilities of software-producing firms—research and development (RD), marketing (MK), and operations (OP)—and hypothesize that in the dynamic, high-technology software industry, RD and MK capabilities are most important for firm survival. We then draw on the competitive dynamics literature to theorize that competitive actions distinguished by a greater emphasis on innovation-related moves will increase firm survival more than actions emphasizing resource-related moves. Finally, we postulate that firms' capabilities will complement their competitive actions in affecting firm survival. Our empirical evaluation examines a cross-sectional, time series panel of 5,827 observations on 870 software companies from 1995 to 2007. We use a stochastic frontier production function to measure the capability for each software firm in each time period. We then use the Cox proportional hazard regression technique to relate capabilities and competitive actions to software firms' failure rates. Unexpectedly, our results reveal that higher OP capability increases software firm survival more than higher MK and RD capabilities. Further, firms with a greater emphasis on innovation-related than resource-related competitive actions have a greater likelihood of survival, and this likelihood increases even further when these firms have higher MK and OP capabilities. Additional analyses of subsectors within the software industry reveal that firms producing visual applications (e.g., graphical and video game software) have the highest MK capability but the lowest OP and RD capabilities and make twice as many innovation-related as resource-related moves. These firms have the highest market values but the worst Altman Z scores, suggesting that they are valued highly but also are at high risk for failure, and indeed the firms in this sector fail at a greater rate than expected. In contrast, firms producing traditional decision-support applications and infrastructure software have different capabilities and make different competitive moves. Our findings suggest that the firms that persist and survive over the long term in the dynamic software industry are able to capitalize on their competitive actions because of their greater capabilities, and particularly OP capabilities. \",\n",
       " 'The cost of enhancing software applications to accommodate new and evolving user requirements is significant. Many enhancement cost-reduction initiatives have focused on increasing software structure in applications. However, while software structure can decrease enhancement effort by localizing data processing, increased effort is also required to comprehend structure. Thus, it is not clear whether high levels of software structure are economically efficient in all situations. In this study, we develop a model of the relationship between software structure and software enhancement costs and errors. We introduce the notion of software structure as a moderator of the relationship between software volatility, total data complexity, and software enhancement outcomes. We posit that it is efficient to more highly structure the more volatile applications, because increased familiarity with the application structure through frequent enhancement enables localization of maintenance effort. For more complex applications, software structure is more beneficial than for less complex applications because it facilitates the comprehension process where it is most needed. Given the downstream enhancement benefits of structure for more volatile and complex applications, we expect that the optimal level of structure is higher for these applications. We empirically evaluate our model using data collected on the business applications of a major mass merchandiser and a large commercial bank. We find that structure moderates the relationship between complexity, volatility, and enhancement outcomes, such that higher levels of structure are more advantageous for the more complex and more volatile applications in terms of reduced enhancement costs and errors. We also find that more structure is designed in for volatile applications and for applications with higher levels of complexity. Finally, we identify application type as a significant factor in predicting which applications are more volatile and more complex at our research sites. That is, applications with induction-based algorithms such as those that support planning, forecasting, and management decision-making activities are more complex and more volatile than applications with rule-based algorithms that support operational and transaction-processing activities. Our results indicate that high investment in software quality practices such as structured design is not economically efficient in all situations. Our findings also suggest the importance of organizational mechanisms in promoting efficient design choices that lead to reduced enhancement costs and errors. ',\n",
       " 'As with many complex design problems, physical database design is difficult, ill-structured, and highly human intensive. In order to effectively construct support systems or improve the practice of database design, it is important to understand how human designers reason about the task. We report an empirical study of physical database design problem solving. Thirteen subjects each solved two physical database design problems: five subjects were experienced designers; eight were graduate students with little or no actual design experience, though they were exposed to the principles of design through coursework. For each problem, subjects were presented with a list of available problem information (hardware, content, and activity data) and were directed to generate a physical design (record structures and access paths) that would minimize retrieval time and storage space. All sessions were audiotaped. Three types of data were incorporated for the analysis: information acquisition patterns, solution generation patterns, and verbal protocol. It was hypothesized that database design reasoning embodies forms of deliberation to reduce problem-solving complexity and that these forms resemble those found in other design problem-solving studies-commonality of task environmental demands will result in commonality in problem-solving methods in response to those demands. In particular, we expected to find specific control strategies, the use of hierarchical abstraction, the use of problem-specific heuristics, and the use of qualtitative reasoning with mental models of dynamic components of the task. Our results indicate that these forms are indeed present and of significant value in physical database design problem solving. Experience played a significant role in determining both the form and substance of reasoning used in physical database design. Both experienced and inexperienced database designers exhibited at least some of these forms of reasoning. Experienced designers, however, effectively applied these forms, demonstrating a substance of reasoning, although their methods of application varied considerably. The least experienced designers did not effectively apply these forms and, lost in the detail of the design problems, were unable to generate reasonable designs. It is concluded that recognition of appropriate reasoning forms and the effective application of these forms arc critical to developing efficient physical database designs. The implications of the findings are discussed. ',\n",
       " \"From a broad perspective, our research can be viewed as investigating the fit of technology to task, the user's view of the fit between technology and task, and the relative importance of each to problem-solving or decision-making performance. The technology investigated in this research is the mode of information presentation. Although there has been a considerable amount of research into problem solving using graphs and tables, until recently the circumstances in which each is more effective have been largely unresolved. Recent research has suggested that performance benefits accrue when cognitive fit occurs, i.e., when factors such as the problem representation and problem solving tools match the characteristics of the task. In this paper, we investigate the effects of the basic paradigm of cognitive fit and extensions to the paradigm in a laboratory experiment that examined the nature of subjects' mental representations as well as problem-solving performance. The experiment, using 128 MBA students in two identical, repeated measures designs, produced the following results: • Performance improved markedly for symbolic tasks when the problem representation matched the task • Performance effects also resulted from matching specific problem-solving skills to the problem representation and the task, and to a lesser extent when the skills matched the task alone. • The incremental effects of matching skills to the problem representation and/or the task were small compared with the primary effects of cognitive fit-that of matching problem representation to task. • A large proportion of problem solvers have insight into the concept of supporting tasks with certain types of problem representation and vice versa. • Participants preferred to use tables rather than graphs; they also preferred to solve symbolic rather than spatial problems. • Finally, the problem representation more significantly influenced the mental representation than did task conceptualization. This research suggests that providing decision support systems to satisfy individual managers' desires will not have a large effect on either the efficiency or the effectiveness of problem solving. Designers should, instead, concentrate on determining the characteristics of the tasks that problem solvers must address, and on supporting those tasks with the appropriate problem representations and support tools. Sufficient evidence now exists to suggest that the notion of cognitive fit may be one aspect ofa general theory of problem solving. Suggestions are made for extending the notion of fit to more complex problem-solving environments. \",\n",
       " \"Given the pervasive use of teams in organizations coupled with high levels of investment in collaboration technology, there is increasing interest in identifying factors that affect the exploration and use of a broader scope of system features so that firms can benefit from the use of such technology. Prior research has called for a deeper understanding of how managers can encourage greater innovation with technology in the workplace. Drawing on the team climate and technology use literatures, we identify team learning climate and team empowerment climate as key factors that affect employees' propensity to explore a new system's features. We develop and test our use in a field study involving 268 employees embedded in 56 work teams. Three main findings come out of this research. First, the results reveal that the two types of team climate differ in their cross-level effects on individual intention to explore, such that team learning climate promotes greater intention to explore, whereas team empowerment climate reduces employees' intention to explore the technology. In addition, we find that team learning climate and team empowerment climate interact in shaping individual intention to explore, such that the presence of a strong learning climate is more effective in promoting intention to explore when teams also have a strong empowerment climate. Second, the findings show that men and women are affected differently by team climate. We find that for men, team empowerment climate has no influence on intention to explore, whereas for women there is a significant negative cross-level effect. Finally, we find that intention to explore has a positive effect on usage scope, suggesting an important link between team climate, individual cognition, and the scope of features used by employees in team settings. Taken together, the model and results highlight the important role of team climate and gender-and the interplay between them-as drivers of technology feature exploration. Our findings, especially those related to team empowerment climate, are counterintuitive when compared to prior literature and offer useful insights for managers. On the one hand, managers should consider leveraging team learning climate to intrinsically stimulate employees to engage in exploration of technology. On the other hand, managers should be cautious and guard against saddling employees with too many additional responsibilities during the stages of exploration and experimentation with system features. It is possible that through an expanded set of responsibilities and expectations fostered by team empowerment climate, employees may be experiencing work overload, thus reducing their likelihood of exploring a broader set of technology features. Managers should be especially attentive to this based on the gender composition of their teams. \",\n",
       " \"Organizational use of information and communications technologies (ICT) is increasingly resulting in negative cognitions in individuals, such as information overload and interruptions. Recent literature has encapsulated these cognitions in the concept of technostress, which is stress caused by an inability to cope with the demands of organizational computer usage. Given the critical role of the user in organizational information processing and accomplishing application-enabled workflows, understanding how these cognitions affect users' satisfaction with ICT and their performance in ICT-mediated tasks is an important step in appropriating benefits from current computing environments. The objective of this paper is to (1) understand the negative effects of technostress on the extent to which end users perceive the applications they use to be satisfactory and can utilize them to improve their performance at work and (2) identify mechanisms that can mitigate these effects. Specifically, we draw from the end-user computing and technostress literature to develop and validate a model that analyzes the effects of factors that create technostress on the individual's satisfaction with, and task performance using, ICT. The model also examines how user involvement in ICT development and support mechanisms for innovation can be used to weaken technostress-creating factors and their outcomes. The results, based on survey data analysis from 233 ICT users from two organizations, show that factors that create technostress reduce the satisfaction of individuals with the ICT they use and the extent to which they can utilize ICT for productivity and innovation in their tasks. Mechanisms that facilitate involvement of users, and encourage them to take risks, learn, explore new ideas, and experiment in the context of ICT use, diminish the factors that create technostress and increase satisfaction with the ICT they use. These mechanisms also have a positive effect on users' appropriation of ICT for productivity and innovation in their tasks. The paper contributes to emerging literature on negative outcomes of ICT use by (1) highlighting the influence of technostress on users' satisfaction and performance (i.e., productivity and innovation in ICT-mediated tasks) with ICT, (2) extending the literature on technostress, which has so far looked largely at the general behavioral and psychological domains, to include the domain of end-user computing, and (3) demonstrating the importance of user involvement and innovation support mechanisms in reducing technostress-creating conditions and their ICT use-related outcomes. \"]"
